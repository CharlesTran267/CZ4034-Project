224,Dior,fast fashion,"The Dior Men’s Summer 2024 Show+Pure Genius!!! As a designer myself, I am always interested in the conceptual process that other designers employ to develop their collections. I watched a companion video to this runway show that explained the design thinking behind the clothing. Creative Director Kim Jones researched the Dior archives and referenced women's collections from the 1960s, but reinterpreted for menswear. They created innovation tweed textiles woven with several different fibers. I particularly love the accessories, the velvet flower jewelry, hand-crafted by Chinese artisans, and the knitted hats, which are the genius of the Dior milliner Stephen Jones. It's great to see designers pushing the envelope like this. I can think of one other designer in the same league, John Galliano, and his collections for Maison Margiela.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=ZJ7PaOLl49w&pp=ygUSRGlvciBmYXN0IGZhc2hpb24g,

806,Dior,quality,"LADY DIOR UNBOXING GONE WRONG!!! | Quality Issues With This $5000 Bag+Hey Carol, my 2 cents: I think you should return the bag and wait for the hardware to improve - even if you exchange it for an identical piece now, you'll always be paranoid about the hardware chipping off again; and it's just not practical to always have to be really precious and careful when using a bag. Since the other bag in the store had the same issue, it doesn't seem like a one-off. When Dior first rolled out their ultra matte hardware there were chipping issues as well and after a few years Dior improved the formula; so maybe you could wait for the same to happen with the rose gold?",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=8EPZci3sVIQ&pp=ygUNRGlvciBxdWFsaXR5IA%3D%3D,

826,Dior,quality,"LADY DIOR UNBOXING GONE WRONG!!! | Quality Issues With This $5000 Bag+I can tell how disappointed you are about the hardware issues (and rightly so, that’s an expensive bag and it should be perfect) so I definitely think you should exchange or return it. If you try and do an exchange and all of them seem to have the same defect, then it’s probably just not meant to be and you shouldn’t settle for anything less than your ideal bag.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=8EPZci3sVIQ&pp=ygUNRGlvciBxdWFsaXR5IA%3D%3D,

850,Dior,quality,"MY DIOR BAG IS DEFECTIVE 💔 & THEY TRIED TO GASLIGHT ME ABOUT IT 🥴+This is the second channel I have sent this comment.  Once Dior knows that you are the original buyer they should be jumping through hoops to make you happy again.  No question it is a defect and their responsibility.  Dior may once have been a reputable company but now they have a customer base willing to pay any amount for anything with Dior on it.  This is why they no longer care about quality or customer service.  As long as it is a Dior store it does not matter if it was purchased online, in Hawaii or where ever.  I watched a woman in a Paris designer boutique.  She went over every item she was purchasing with a fine tooth comb.  I thought, ""good for her"", but that would not have made any difference with this bag as it happened over time.  I would be ticked off if it happened to a $35.00 bag.  I would not pay even $100 for this.  Anything out of my sewing room would be better made without a drop of glue.  Very poor workmanship.  Very bad customer service.

856,Dior,quality,"MY DIOR BAG IS DEFECTIVE 💔 & THEY TRIED TO GASLIGHT ME ABOUT IT 🥴+I am so late to this (just found you!) but I actually work in supply chain (making abrasive material such as sandpaper, etc.) & we have experienced issues with glue from multiple suppliers within the last few years turning colors & not adhering property & falling off when in use. Have had to do quality inspections and returns multiple times. The issue I see happening here with these bags is that quality inspection would miss this upon initial inspection before they ship them out, due to the glue oxidizing over time and not initially. I’d hope for the cost they would have asked you for your serial/mfr number and tracked where the bag was glued and who that glue was from, so that they don’t use that supplier. However, this issue isn’t happening with the same suppliers every time, either. With allllll that being said, I’d go with a darker bag. There is at least a 25% chance of this happening again with your next bag, unless stringent steps have been taken at the dior manufacturing facility…",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=E61IjTX9LpQ&pp=ygUNRGlvciBxdWFsaXR5IA%3D%3D,

I will be selective on how much I am willing to pay for a so cold “luxury” good (with a limited lifetime). No Good lasts forever. I would rather buy another property or invest. Once I promote I would rather spend money on travelling with my family. Long lasting memories. In fact many rich people became rich because they did not waste their money on a disposable goods.

Dior’s production is much more . back Dior price is just a bit cheaper and the size is also about the same . In addition, if prince Diana  didn’t  carry deals back nobody would care to buy lady Dior .  . Every time with my husband tries to get some suits from Tio they always ask him we need to get your wife to come in to buy all the things we can customize a bag the way she wants it or we can make exactly the way she likes whatever she purchased from Chanel we can do the same style for her , or we can let her design the way she wants it. Why would I want to spend so much money and have to design my own ? This is not  some kids doing the artwork . I don’t want to spend money you have to spend so much time to think what to do. I spent so much money is because I won the quality I want to convenienceBasically I just don’t like to spend money to have .  When a bag can be purchased so easily that means money you’re spending US 5000 or 6000 dollars  everybody can get it because their production in more than enough . If they keep calling you text you every day or every other day that means they don’t have a lot of business ? That’s how afoot has been trained to do . Does if matter what they are trying to sell you . bags ready to wear or their jewelry & watch? If they have so many customers fighting for their items , no sales would need to keep calling or texting you  I have always have items from  Chanel , I always have to reserve ahead of time but it’s not a problem for anyone who is a loyal customer .  It is not about the resale value only in fact this is not even what I first consider it is about spending the same kind of money but anyone can have what I have so easily, that is why I don’t like to wear some thing as a uniform so I don’t preferred to choose deal their production is way too much , and their sales person is too annoying the worst training place ever ever seen",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=w6k8jj-kgeM&pp=ygUORGlvciB3b3J0aCBpdCA%3D,

2547,Dior,thoughts,"iann dior - thought it was (ft. Machine Gun Kelly & Travis Barker) (Official Lyric Video)+Damn this song should be called, “why do blonde white guys in America wanna be either black or Justin Bieber” lol MGK really lost all ability to make good music, I used to kinda like when he was ‘trying’ to be gangsta & rap but I guess he couldn’t hang with the real thugs behind the scenes so he’s forced to do generic pop/rock. Kinda feels like if he had a break from stardom he’d be able to see that, but he seems to have his head up his ass if he doesn’t understand how awesome slipknot’s music is. Respect those that came before you. If you put more effort into just one truly good composition, maybe that song will have a chance of being remembered… but you’re no Mozart. Mozart died without fame, and he will live forever. You? You’re no Mozart.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=t3x50GiKEbs&pp=ygUORGlvciB0aG91Z2h0cyA%3D,

Debe ser muy interesante un año de trabajo en Dior en estos momentos, como experiencia. La recuperación y valorización, a través de la indumentaria y el textil en la moda, de tradiciones textiles ancestrales y que dieron de ellas en su momento a lo que actualmente es y ha sido desde más de dos siglos la industria textil y luego el sistema de la moda.

2721,Dior,comparison,"Chanel Classic Flap vs Lady Dior *in-depth comparison*+As a practical lady, one thing i love about the lady dior is that i can bring out a lot more with me compared to a chanel. The capacity makes it more worth the $, it makes you look elegant and stands out, it can be worn in the day or for nights out. Its an accessory on its own.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=F1I84lOyma4&pp=ygUQRGlvciBjb21wYXJpc29uIA%3D%3D,

2724,Dior,comparison,"Chanel Classic Flap vs Lady Dior *in-depth comparison*+I have 1 CF and other dior bags like the toujoules and book tote, i would go for practicability as in the usage based on my lifestyle. The CF in my opinion is enough for a dress up or down purse and i think its enough. The rest of the bags in my collection are more for practicability purpose eg to carry laptops, ipads, etc.  And the CF is evergreen, it will never go out of style just like the LD.. but LD resale price are really bad although they are so elegant and beautiful.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=F1I84lOyma4&pp=ygUQRGlvciBjb21wYXJpc29uIA%3D%3D,

2731,Dior,comparison,Chanel Classic Flap vs Lady Dior *in-depth comparison*+I have both but honestly I don’t reach for either of them  the lady dior I have to baby and flap opening kinda annoys me. The classic flap is heavy and don’t carry much and I feel like I’m showing off everytime I wear it so I always end up using another bag,https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=F1I84lOyma4&pp=ygUQRGlvciBjb21wYXJpc29uIA%3D%3D,
2732,Dior,comparison,"Chanel Classic Flap vs Lady Dior *in-depth comparison*+Hi!  I am brand new to your channel and have watched your videos when you first purchased the LD.  Thank you for being very informative and giving such a concise, critical evaluation of the bag.  I also loved this video I just watched, as well.  I have a few CF's and love all of them, but the Chanel HUGE price increases have just turned me off to purchasing any more of their bags, which is such a shame.  I seriously looked at the Lady Dior medium size bag when I was in Dallas this past spring.  I love the look of the bag but am now possibly interested in the small size because of the shoulder strap.  Does anyone have anything to share about getting the LD in the calfskin leather instead of the Lambskin for durability?  Thanks for making such an enjoyable and informative video.  Take care!",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=F1I84lOyma4&pp=ygUQRGlvciBjb21wYXJpc29uIA%3D%3D,

2734,Dior,comparison,"Chanel Classic Flap vs Lady Dior *in-depth comparison*+Both you have are very beautiful, but I am Team Classic Flap, primarily for design and practicality: 1) I do not like the chunky handle of the Lady Dior (seems a little old lady-ish, doesn't always look good with different sizes, doesn't look like you could comfortably hang this bag on your shoulder), 2) I think I prefer having handbags that have more compartments available for organization, and 3) I'm not a big fan of the Dior logo charms. I recently heard them described in another review as sounding like ""windchimes,"" which I know would bother me. I'm not opposed to the idea of getting a Lady Dior in the future, but I would need to see a style that really speaks to me (such as the houndstooth variation from a few years ago, which seems very difficult to find) or would need to jump on a model that has the charms either removed entirely or simply not made of metal.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=F1I84lOyma4&pp=ygUQRGlvciBjb21wYXJpc29uIA%3D%3D,

2762,Dior,comparison,Chanel Classic Flap vs Lady Dior *in-depth comparison*+I prefer Dior because Chanel it's really poor quality whether it's makeup bag jewelry or clothes because 1 week ago I went to Chanel to buy glasses a bag and a knit I take the bag out of the box and the chain fits the knit there was a hole seriously I do not recommend this brand I find that Dior has better quality it is better and more beautiful,https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=F1I84lOyma4&pp=ygUQRGlvciBjb21wYXJpc29uIA%3D%3D,

2768,Dior,comparison,Chanel Classic Flap vs Lady Dior *in-depth comparison*+Great info!!!  I own a vintage Chanel Diana bag & am researching Lady Dior bags.  I am a history buff & love that the Lady Dior wasn’t called that until Princess Diana carried one that was gifted to her on a trip to Argentina.

I watched a companion video to this runway show that explained the design thinking behind the clothing. Creative Director Kim Jones researched the Dior archives and referenced women's collections from the 1960s, but reinterpreted for menswear. They created innovation tweed textiles woven with several different fibers. I particularly love the accessories, the velvet flower jewelry, hand-crafted by Chinese artisans, and the knitted hats, which are the genius of the Dior milliner Stephen Jones. It's great to see designers pushing the envelope like this. I can think of one other designer in the same league, John Galliano, and his collections for Maison Margiela.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=ZJ7PaOLl49w&pp=ygUMRGlvciB0cmVuZHMg,

3991,Forever 21,waste,"The Decline of Forever 21...What Happened?+Back in the mid 2010s I used to LOVE forever 21. They had this sweet and cute style of clothes that I couldn’t find anywhere else. I also live in Canada so it was harder to find a location that wasn’t in a big city. Then the bankruptcy happened and I’m not positive but I’m pretty sure they closed almost all of their Canadian locations. Fast forward to earlier this year and a “forever 21” opens as almost like a corner shop in The Bay which is kinda like a Sears with fancier brands. They also had their clothes occasionally in other discount fast fashion places like Urban Planet. The one thing I notice right away is that although prices are still in that “average/slightly above average” area, their clothes have gotten remarkably lower quality. Like, almost lower than Shein/Romwe quality in some cases. Everything is made of cheap polyester even when it doesn’t have to be, Seams aren’t finished or have fraying or thread sticking out, zippers are ripped or really poor quality and you can just feel the clothes falling apart even while you try them on. Even with items on sale, it’s hard to justify the purchase because I’m thinking “oh I’ll have to sew this” or “oh I’ll have to reinforce this”. And like, there’s some items I have from before the bankruptcy that I still wear almost 10 years later, but now anything I buy from there feels like I’ll only get a wash or two out of them before they’re ruined. I can only imagine the quality control and conditions of their clothing manufacturers…. Plus… maybe im just older now at 26, but I find the clothes not all that unique anymore? They often use the same patterns or fabric for multiple items and they’re not as cute as they are either just edgy or something you’d wear on a night out. I remember getting cute cardigans from there, and dress clothes and nice blouses and now that’s nowhere to be found. It’s just sad the direction they’ve gone in because I really had a lot of loyalty and favour for the brand but now it feels like a completely different store. And they don’t even have that much stock anyways, either online or in store. It’s just disappointing honestly.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=wrKIrPWTag0&pp=ygURRm9yZXZlciAyMSB3YXN0ZSA%3D,

Or it doesn’t fit well because it’s made for 1 body type. So it ends up on sale for $5. This is a never ending cycle. On top of that the stores are too large and too full to properly maintain.

4206,Forever 21,fast fashion,"Is it the end of “Fast Fashion”? Topshop & Forever 21 are bankrupt ǀ  Justine Leconte+It's funny that I am watching this episode today. Yesterday, I received a skirt I purchased on Etsy that I thought was hand made in the States. The shipping label states that the package was shipped from China, which can only mean that the garment was made in China. I felt mislead by the seller, who, it seems, must be a third party seller. I shop Etsy to support hand crafted artisans. Anyway, I wrote a review (which I hope will not get deleted) that I was disappointed to learn my garment was made by child labor, or at the very least, made by an grossly underpaid worker. I think we in the West have become to used to immediate fashion and to tossing or donating clothing after only a couple of wearings that many of us are unwilling to pair a fair price for quality garments. My frustration: even in high-end department stores, the quality of the fibers and fabric are not worth the price tag.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=mCF1A6uc7jw&pp=ygUYRm9yZXZlciAyMSBmYXN0IGZhc2hpb24g,

4237,Forever 21,fast fashion,"Is it the end of “Fast Fashion”? Topshop & Forever 21 are bankrupt ǀ  Justine Leconte+Justine, I think the targeting of these brands being in the extremes of the price range indicates one thing for me - economic inequality in the general population. It shows the decline of the middle class in these countries. One thing you must notice is that trends are global now because of media and hence aspirations of people are very similar towards fashion, be it in the US or India. But of course their incomes are not similar. So these people are left with the consumerism habits of the rich but no money to afford those wishes. Hence they turn to fast fashion. Thankfully, with education, more people are willing to set aside personal aspirations and look at the bigger picture. Many are buying recycled products or going minimal. I think there lies the answer. Make lasting clothes, reduce the pressure of consumerism through media, buy less, wear longer.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=mCF1A6uc7jw&pp=ygUYRm9yZXZlciAyMSBmYXN0IGZhc2hpb24g,

Topshop & Forever 21 are bankrupt ǀ  Justine Leconte+As a person who remembers growing up with self made/re-made clothes, I see great value in small, local brands and businesses. Of course for a while we were all thrilled with cheap and seamingly effortless neverending trend-festival of cheap fashion. But after having a closer look on the price of it, quality of it, there is no way back to fast fashion.  A friend who recently moved to Latvia once mentioned that we have a lot of fabric/sewing material stores, asked if people here make their own clothes (in surprise). I havent thought about it, but, yes, we still do (probably in all Baltics and post-soviet countries). So, I think, that also plays a role in price estimation. When you know what it takes to make a garment - you more likely will be ready to pay fair price for good item. In that case person is highly suspicious to 2,50Eur bra and do not hesitate to pay 100-200Eur for a fitted office dress.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=mCF1A6uc7jw&pp=ygUYRm9yZXZlciAyMSBmYXN0IGZhc2hpb24g,

I usually don't find much that I like or want when I walk into F21 (before it shut down in Canada) but I think that's just due to the fact that I get anxiety in stores and I don't have the time of day to stop and look at every single product. I will say, it's pretty shady that on their site, what seems to be the ""reviews"" is a section called ""why did you choose this product"" which is essentially people saying good things about why they wanted to buy it so that it looks like the reviews are good but you have to actually dig deeper to find the product reviews, if there are any.

6513,Forever 21,thoughts,"Carrie Bradshaw Wears Forever 21 & Fans Have Thoughts! | E! News+I bet it's part of the storyline. I bet her character is trying to stay young to keep her podcast going or something so maybe she takes a brand deal? Or maybe it's intentional that Carrie didn't plan on seeing Natasha. Therefore Carrie is probably equally as embarrassed to be cornered now that she's no longer with Big to be caught wearing something so unlike her natural dress. Kind of like the first time Natasha's character is introduced. They're at a Hamptons BBQ and Big has just married Natasha. She runs into them while wearing a cowboy hat and bando top. Maybe this is to further highlight the women's age difference and life choices and perhaps where both women's choices have propelled them to this full circle moment..... Whenever Carrie reads about their wedding announcement in the paper she ends up stating how she catches herself trying to be this perfect person for him with her perfect outfits as if that would magically make the man she was with commit to her because she knows how to put together an outfit. She even called Natasha ""shiny hair style section and I'm the ad in the back of the paper next to the penile implants.""Just a thought that her character may not want to be caught wearing that anymore than we want to see it.....",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=FBMx-HRLz6c&pp=ygUURm9yZXZlciAyMSB0aG91Z2h0cyA%3D,

6589,Forever 21,thoughts,"The Decline of Forever 21...What Happened?+Apart from the business side of it, they have been lacking in the fashion aspect. One of their biggest competitors would be Shien.

6601,Forever 21,thoughts,"The Decline of Forever 21...What Happened?+Forever 21's position is hardly unique. When you build a brand focused on young female fashion, the countdown to decline begins the minute you open. Some innovate enough to survive longer, but still lose their luster. Selling ""hip and trendy"" to young women when their mom has memories of frequenting your establishment is a tough psychology to navigate past.

6602,Forever 21,thoughts,"The Decline of Forever 21...What Happened?+I shopped here for most of high school, the last time I actually bought anything from forever 21 was 2018 right before my birthday, I was searching for an outfit to wear for my senior pictures and I found two outfits I absolutely loved, the most frustrating thing I experienced was definitely the lack of quality with my clothes, sometimes I’d spend so much time and money on something I’d wear once or not at all, their leggings were always see through and the fabric never seemed to be the same, after graduation I was working a part time job as my full time job and had a bit more disposable income than I did before and started shopping at American eagle, aerie and pink, I’ve noticed the quality in pink go down dramatically over the years (back to school shopped there since middle school) I have to say the clothes I have purchased from American eagle and aerie I have re-worn year after year and are much more livable, I think my generation is becoming more aware of the quality of clothes and the evils of fast fashion which could also be contributing to forever 21s downfall",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=wrKIrPWTag0&pp=ygUURm9yZXZlciAyMSB0aG91Z2h0cyA%3D,
6603,Forever 21,thoughts,"The Decline of Forever 21...What Happened?+Back in the mid 2010s I used to LOVE forever 21. They had this sweet and cute style of clothes that I couldn’t find anywhere else. I also live in Canada so it was harder to find a location that wasn’t in a big city. Then the bankruptcy happened and I’m not positive but I’m pretty sure they closed almost all of their Canadian locations. Fast forward to earlier this year and a “forever 21” opens as almost like a corner shop in The Bay which is kinda like a Sears with fancier brands. They also had their clothes occasionally in other discount fast fashion places like Urban Planet. The one thing I notice right away is that although prices are still in that “average/slightly above average” area, their clothes have gotten remarkably lower quality. Like, almost lower than Shein/Romwe quality in some cases. Everything is made of cheap polyester even when it doesn’t have to be, Seams aren’t finished or have fraying or thread sticking out, zippers are ripped or really poor quality and you can just feel the clothes falling apart even while you try them on. Even with items on sale, it’s hard to justify the purchase because I’m thinking “oh I’ll have to sew this” or “oh I’ll have to reinforce this”. And like, there’s some items I have from before the bankruptcy that I still wear almost 10 years later, but now anything I buy from there feels like I’ll only get a wash or two out of them before they’re ruined. I can only imagine the quality control and conditions of their clothing manufacturers…. Plus… maybe im just older now at 26, but I find the clothes not all that unique anymore? They often use the same patterns or fabric for multiple items and they’re not as cute as they are either just edgy or something you’d wear on a night out. I remember getting cute cardigans from there, and dress clothes and nice blouses and now that’s nowhere to be found. It’s just sad the direction they’ve gone in because I really had a lot of loyalty and favour for the brand but now it feels like a completely different store. And they don’t even have that much stock anyways, either online or in store. It’s just disappointing honestly.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=wrKIrPWTag0&pp=ygUURm9yZXZlciAyMSB0aG91Z2h0cyA%3D,

The quality of the clothes are hit and miss, you CAN find some good items if you pay attention to the material and stitching. But please, for the love of God, WASH YOUR CLOTHES BEFORE YOU WEAR THEM.

There’s too much product coming in everyday and they’re not making smart purchases. A lot of the new stuff is ugly and doesn’t look right on the hanger so it doesn’t sell. Or it doesn’t fit well because it’s made for 1 body type. So it ends up on sale for $5. This is a never ending cycle. On top of that the stores are too large and too full to properly maintain.

At Forever 21, though, I was able to find clothes that fit and weren't designed for kids, just really small women like me.

Afterwards, I had to walk up a huge hill to get back to my hotel and while doing so some fucking muppet flicked his cigarette and it went into my bag and burned my jeanssss bahhh. Of course the burnt pair was the last in my size.

I get stuff from China quicker.  One of my recent orders was sent to Puerto Rico.  Yup. It's still there. Lost in shipping. It took TEN fucking emails to FN to get my order refunded.  Also, they never have what I want in stock. In contrast, I placed two orders to F21 last week. I received them, standard shipping,  in 2 days.

Shit pay, small place(mall location), and no upwelling rewards (the credit cards). I loved the girls there just not management. I tend to keep my clothes for years so I did buy my wardrobe there and I just bought items that were always in fashion.

When you build a brand focused on young female fashion, the countdown to decline begins the minute you open. Some innovate enough to survive longer, but still lose their luster. Selling ""hip and trendy"" to young women when their mom has memories of frequenting your establishment is a tough psychology to navigate past.

7629,Forever 21,ethically sourced,"The Decline of Forever 21...What Happened?+Back in the mid 2010s I used to LOVE forever 21. They had this sweet and cute style of clothes that I couldn’t find anywhere else. I also live in Canada so it was harder to find a location that wasn’t in a big city. Then the bankruptcy happened and I’m not positive but I’m pretty sure they closed almost all of their Canadian locations. Fast forward to earlier this year and a “forever 21” opens as almost like a corner shop in The Bay which is kinda like a Sears with fancier brands. They also had their clothes occasionally in other discount fast fashion places like Urban Planet. The one thing I notice right away is that although prices are still in that “average/slightly above average” area, their clothes have gotten remarkably lower quality. Like, almost lower than Shein/Romwe quality in some cases. Everything is made of cheap polyester even when it doesn’t have to be, Seams aren’t finished or have fraying or thread sticking out, zippers are ripped or really poor quality and you can just feel the clothes falling apart even while you try them on. Even with items on sale, it’s hard to justify the purchase because I’m thinking “oh I’ll have to sew this” or “oh I’ll have to reinforce this”. And like, there’s some items I have from before the bankruptcy that I still wear almost 10 years later, but now anything I buy from there feels like I’ll only get a wash or two out of them before they’re ruined. I can only imagine the quality control and conditions of their clothing manufacturers…. Plus… maybe im just older now at 26, but I find the clothes not all that unique anymore? They often use the same patterns or fabric for multiple items and they’re not as cute as they are either just edgy or something you’d wear on a night out. I remember getting cute cardigans from there, and dress clothes and nice blouses and now that’s nowhere to be found. It’s just sad the direction they’ve gone in because I really had a lot of loyalty and favour for the brand but now it feels like a completely different store. And they don’t even have that much stock anyways, either online or in store. It’s just disappointing honestly.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=wrKIrPWTag0&pp=ygUdRm9yZXZlciAyMSBldGhpY2FsbHkgc291cmNlZCA%3D,

7780,ASOS,waste,"The environmental disaster fuelled by used clothes and fast fashion | Foreign Correspondent+Sad. I work at a thrift store and I'm disgusted at the amount of stuff people buy and throw away. Equally frustrating is the crap that does get donated, dirty, stained, ripped, smelly clothes, ripped up moldy books, boxes covered in rat and cockroach shit, other items broken and unusable to anybody, etc, and we basically end up throwing there trash away for them. We will even give what we can away for free, but the amount of trash, ugh. I can't stand this fast cheap fashion and low quality clothes that's everywhere now, quality so bad that after a first use and wash is no good anymore. Then what we sell for very cheap everyone wants it for cheaper, it's disgusting, and I would say at the very least half if not more of the customer are reselling it. I don't have a problem with resellers but many want it for cheap or free and are super pushy. I bust my ass all day long and it's not worth it dealing with customers and donations of trash.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=bB3kuuBPVys&pp=ygULQVNPUyB3YXN0ZSA%3D,

7785,ASOS,waste,"The environmental disaster fuelled by used clothes and fast fashion | Foreign Correspondent+Quite enlightening documentary.  Thank you for producing this.  The fashion industry contributes so much to environmental decline.  They overproduce by 40%?  That's ridiculous.  When I was growing up in the United States in the 1980's, the biggest social faux pas was to wear the same clothes twice within a week.   Some aimed to not wear the same clothes twice, ever.  I hope subsequent generations are changing to realize how much of a waste that is.  I personally wear my clothes until they're ripped.  I then donate to charity.  If anything, I hope the cloth from my attire can be repurposed as blankets, curtains or other materials.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=bB3kuuBPVys&pp=ygULQVNPUyB3YXN0ZSA%3D,

7787,ASOS,waste,The environmental disaster fuelled by used clothes and fast fashion | Foreign Correspondent+1 year ago this was a giant issue. Now it is getting harder and harder to get clothes at the thrift shop due to it being trendy and the resellers. Great for the thrift shop owners and the charities who profit from it. Not so great for the people who need a good bargain for clothes. Trends seem to always have their victims.,https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=bB3kuuBPVys&pp=ygULQVNPUyB3YXN0ZSA%3D,

7789,ASOS,waste,The environmental disaster fuelled by used clothes and fast fashion | Foreign Correspondent+After volunteering at lifeline here in Australia for a couple of years I can confirm they make us keep all the good stuff to sell in store. We are specifically instructed to put damaged or unsellable goods in massive bags like the ones shown in the video to send off to companies for rags or to send to places like this. It's really sad. I always tried to sneak good clothes into those bags but depending on the store manager they can be quite firm and keep a watchful eye on keeping the 'good stuff'. I hope we can take a deeper look into these compaines and come up with a solution for this that benifits everyone.,https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=bB3kuuBPVys&pp=ygULQVNPUyB3YXN0ZSA%3D,

7793,ASOS,waste,"The environmental disaster fuelled by used clothes and fast fashion | Foreign Correspondent+What is being called ""second hand"" is actually two or three times removed from the initial donation point.

I have completely stopped donating clothing or other textiles for this reason. -I wear my clothes until they become too worn, and then I either repurpose them (cleaning rags for instance, or making patches to repair another piece) and if I cannot find any use for them I dispose of them properly. In the rare cases that I have something that is not yet worn out that I want to get rid of, I give it away to someone who wants it for themselves. When I buy clothing, which is rare (I spend less than 100 Euros on clothes every year) , I try to buy cotton items wherever possible, to reduce the amount of synthetic materials.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=bB3kuuBPVys&pp=ygULQVNPUyB3YXN0ZSA%3D,

Ralph Lauren, is one example, a brand I used to love.  Last fall they had a pleated skirt that I looked at, but $400 for a 100% polyester skirt?

The quantity will blow your mind!!! Not to mention the amount of markdowns that are still in the stockroom because there’s not enough space on the sales floor because there is such a back up of unsold clothing.

8098,ASOS,fast fashion,"5 myths Fast Fashion brands want you to believe (SheIn, H&M, Zara, ASOS…)+A few years ago, I was in the process of cleaning out my clothes and shoes and stopped. Instead, I created capsule wardrobes out of the clothes/shoes I already owned and started rotating those capsules. I figured that instead of throwing them away or donating them (and they will eventually be thrown away by those organizations), I could make the best use of the money I spent and stay more enviroment friendly. Also, I started learning to sew and now when some clothes are no longer good, I keep the usable fabric and all the good haberdashery to use in a new garment I create. So, I stopped buying new clothes and try to use everything I already own in the way they are or in the refashioned way. It works very well. Having my own multiple capsule wardrobes makes my brain think that I have ""new clothes"" with every single capsule ;-) In the future, I will only buy clothes/shoes that are absolutely necessary and from a sustainable source. In the meantime, I will continue to use every bit of my existing wardrobe and make the best use of it. Your videos and insights have made me rethink my choices and start making changes in a way that is not only good for me, but for the environment as well.

Much like addictions (which so-called retail therapy is becoming), the urge is for spiritual knowledge but it gets twisted into a seeking for euphoria the ""fast fashion"" way.

8102,ASOS,fast fashion,"5 myths Fast Fashion brands want you to believe (SheIn, H&M, Zara, ASOS…)+I never understand, why people claim that they can only afford Fast Fashion, when there is the option to buy second hand. I mostly go for higher end brands like Ralph Lauren, Lacoste or Boss. Yes, I know that not everything is perfect for these brands either, including working conditions and that you mostly pay for the brand these days. However, the advantage of this brands is once the clothing item is used and the price has dropped, they actually hold their value. I bought some second hand Ralph Lauren clothing, wore it for 2 years and then sold it for the same money I paid for. So in fact, I didn't spend anything and the item is still used buy someone else and not thrown away.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=dRdGfcoHATo&pp=ygUSQVNPUyBmYXN0IGZhc2hpb24g,

I buy very few and never from these brands. In France we also see that these giants of fast fashion harm the existing brands and shops (camaieu, promod etc.) ... so it is a vicious circle. 15 years ago I tried to boycott any item made in Asia, and buy from brands such as Maje etc. and then they began to produce in Asia as well. So the question of poor quality overpriced is also key. Overall I have the feeling that the quality of clothes has been decreased sharply this decade.

Tbh it just feels like we're doing unpaid labor for these companies. They can put thousands of shitty items on their websites, and then we have to spend OUR time and money to figure out which 1% of the clothes are actually cute and decent quality.

Sleeves too short & too narrow, busts too tight, extremely short-waisted clothing, etc. I think this is because of the market for which the clothing is prepared. Chinese women tend to be (though not always!) quite petite, thin arms, short waisted, etc.  However, non-Asian bodies do not typically fit this profile.

Not to mention you got absolutely nothing that would flatter you, really. I think ASOS has some fine fast fashion.

Unless someone buys a tailored outfit, it's never going to fit right because everyone's body is different so it's not really about the brand, all clothes are manufactured with sizing differences. No matter how much I've paid for an outfit (even up to $2000), it's just NEVER fitted perfectly because my body isn't the same size top and bottom and my boobs are just not proportionate to my waist and I don't see how any company is going to make that any better? And to be fair, all these clothes can be returned. It's not like as if the companies are forcing you to accept their imperfect sizing. I'm not by any means a hardcore ASOS fan, I've never bought anything from there myself but I don't agree with this brand bashing because not a lot of people can afford to pay more for pieces and the idea of a capsule wardrobe just isn't for everyone either.

Sorry, but since i discovered asos (during a time in my life wjen i couldn't fit into clothes of any of the high street stores in my city), my mission has become to introduce as many people as i can to asos. Your point of view is very narrow and strict. You should take some other things into consideration too.

Would be nice if you would recommend some good ethical stores with low pricing. Like, fast-fashion is bad, we get it. But there are people who cannot afford paying 40 EUR for t-short or 80 EUR for dress. Btw, a lot of people recommend to use only second-hand in such case - but I don't think it's very nice to say that poor people (or even middle-class people, but from developing countries) don't deserve any new clothes. Like, wtf? Also, when it comes to regular argument ""buy expensive clothes and you'll wear them for ages"" - how about children clothes?

8891,ASOS,quality,"ASOS: are their clothes worth your money? ǀ Fashion haul but different ǀ Justine Leconte+The best when it comes to the quality&ethics is to order clothes from a local tailor/seamstress. I tried myself,- normal seamstress takes 50-80€ for the blouse, which is made of the material you choose yourself, fits ideally, plus this seamstress works in good conditions in her own atelier and pays taxes in EU. Many big companies sell blouses for 100€, and from this 100€ the worker, who made it, hardly gets equivalent of 1€, textile costs 2€, 20€ is paid for commercials&promotion of the brand, - and the rest goes into the pockets of company-owners.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=OBCbEjnjhuY&pp=ygUNQVNPUyBxdWFsaXR5IA%3D%3D,

Operators have a large distribution network in general. They raise a bunch of money and/or take on high leverage in order to buy a brand on the upswing. They pump the inventory into their distribution network until the market is saturated. Once the brand fades, inventory balloons, margins dissipates, cash flow evaporates and the stock price falls as most brands have no salvage value, no moats, with except some of course. After that the operators restructure to kill the brand and start again.. that’s the brand cycle. There is nothing wrong with owning such businesses.

9353,ASOS,worth it,"ASOS: are their clothes worth your money? ǀ Fashion haul but different ǀ Justine Leconte+I lived in China for two years, and came across many of the same issues that you mention in your video in clothing I purchased there.  Sleeves too short & too narrow, busts too tight, extremely short-waisted clothing, etc. I think this is because of the market for which the clothing is prepared. Chinese women tend to be (though not always!) quite petite, thin arms, short waisted, etc.  However, non-Asian bodies do not typically fit this profile. My suspicion would be that Asos clothing is either made in China, or used clothing originally made for the Chinese market. Also, I really appreciate your videos, Justine!

The dresses were not from the tall range, so I find it unfair to say they’re not well tailored for not fitting a taller woman.

I like your channel but as a designer I'm surprised that YOU were surprised by how any of it turned out. I feel like the pictures were pretty dang accurate. Of course they're being worn by some beautiful women, with excellent lighting. I'm not a designer and knew exactly what you were getting into, and not because I was being skeptical. You even at one point mention how shocked you were by some the fabric on the black dress being so thick. How did you think it kept its shape? Not to mention you got absolutely nothing that would flatter you, really. I think ASOS has some fine fast fashion. Fast fashion does mean you're sacrificing quality, and potentially ethical production, etc. But that's its whole purpose. It's meant to be as disposable as the trends.

9396,ASOS,worth it,"ASOS: are their clothes worth your money? ǀ Fashion haul but different ǀ Justine Leconte+Hate to say this but I don't actually see the point of this video really. Unless someone buys a tailored outfit, it's never going to fit right because everyone's body is different so it's not really about the brand, all clothes are manufactured with sizing differences. No matter how much I've paid for an outfit (even up to $2000), it's just NEVER fitted perfectly because my body isn't the same size top and bottom and my boobs are just not proportionate to my waist and I don't see how any company is going to make that any better? And to be fair, all these clothes can be returned. It's not like as if the companies are forcing you to accept their imperfect sizing. I'm not by any means a hardcore ASOS fan, I've never bought anything from there myself but I don't agree with this brand bashing because not a lot of people can afford to pay more for pieces and the idea of a capsule wardrobe just isn't for everyone either.

Many big companies sell blouses for 100€, and from this 100€ the worker, who made it, hardly gets equivalent of 1€, textile costs 2€, 20€ is paid for commercials&promotion of the brand, - and the rest goes into the pockets of company-owners.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=OBCbEjnjhuY&pp=ygUOQVNPUyB3b3J0aCBpdCA%3D,

This issue with the sweater bag imo, it's cool...but if you put things in it, it's gonna bulge and I don't like that, but it's a cool idea.

Sleeves too short & too narrow, busts too tight, extremely short-waisted clothing, etc. I think this is because of the market for which the clothing is prepared. Chinese women tend to be (though not always!) quite petite, thin arms, short waisted, etc.  However, non-Asian bodies do not typically fit this profile.

The dresses were not from the tall range, so I find it unfair to say they’re not well tailored for not fitting a taller woman.

You even at one point mention how shocked you were by some the fabric on the black dress being so thick. How did you think it kept its shape? Not to mention you got absolutely nothing that would flatter you, really. I think ASOS has some fine fast fashion.

Unless someone buys a tailored outfit, it's never going to fit right because everyone's body is different so it's not really about the brand, all clothes are manufactured with sizing differences. No matter how much I've paid for an outfit (even up to $2000), it's just NEVER fitted perfectly because my body isn't the same size top and bottom and my boobs are just not proportionate to my waist and I don't see how any company is going to make that any better? And to be fair, all these clothes can be returned. It's not like as if the companies are forcing you to accept their imperfect sizing. I'm not by any means a hardcore ASOS fan, I've never bought anything from there myself but I don't agree with this brand bashing because not a lot of people can afford to pay more for pieces and the idea of a capsule wardrobe just isn't for everyone either.

Pretty basic selection with prices I wasn't too excited about. Found a great pair of jeans, but that was it. Then, I went to Chicago for school and found an actual TopShop store and was BLOWN AWAY.

Because those dolls had style  it’d be cute to see how it looks on someone. You could do different looks, maybe one for each doll, and the last one could be a “Me if I was a Bratz doll” look and you do y’all’s own style OR have the person youre with in the video choose the outfits for each other. Or if not Bratz y’all could do the same but with Barbie outfits and It’d totally go with the Barbie movie when it comes out.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=XVUCuCutA8o&pp=ygUOQVNPUyBvcGluaW9ucyA%3D,

10658,ASOS,thoughts,Shopping ASOS In Store vs. Online! * Which is better?! *+I did not know ASOS does in store shopping. I buy from them alot and find their website very hit and miss because their photos are very hard to see what garments actually look like irl...I've bought stuff from them again and again and upon receiving them I'm like this looks nothing like the photos/ models so it can be quite annoying. Especially going through the return process... Anyway that's my opinion.... I guess it's just a gamble.,https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=XVUCuCutA8o&pp=ygUOQVNPUyB0aG91Z2h0cyA%3D,

10661,ASOS,thoughts,"Shopping ASOS In Store vs. Online! * Which is better?! *+I remember when my local Nordstrom first got TopShop in 2012 and I was soooo excited to finally experience what the UK girlies were raving about, but was ultimately disappointed. Pretty basic selection with prices I wasn't too excited about. Found a great pair of jeans, but that was it. Then, I went to Chicago for school and found an actual TopShop store and was BLOWN AWAY. Asos needs their own brick and mortar or a significantly expanded section because Nordstrom doesn't seem to represent these online clothing brands well.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=XVUCuCutA8o&pp=ygUOQVNPUyB0aG91Z2h0cyA%3D,

10663,ASOS,thoughts,"Shopping ASOS In Store vs. Online! * Which is better?! *+Random video idea,but the first outfit Drew was wearing instantly reminded me of the Sasha Bratz Genie Magic Doll, and it made me think what if you guys did a video recreating Bratz outfits irl? Because those dolls had style  it’d be cute to see how it looks on someone. You could do different looks, maybe one for each doll, and the last one could be a “Me if I was a Bratz doll” look and you do y’all’s own style OR have the person youre with in the video choose the outfits for each other. Or if not Bratz y’all could do the same but with Barbie outfits and It’d totally go with the Barbie movie when it comes out.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=XVUCuCutA8o&pp=ygUOQVNPUyB0aG91Z2h0cyA%3D,

I just wished this chanel stopped promoting (even if not intentional or direct) horrible fast fashion brands…  ASOS is know for their horrid labor conditions, workers should have the right to a living wage, collective bargaining, an abuse-free work environment which this company does not provide. On top of that, brands like ASOS that mass-produce such cheap, poorly-made clothing perpetuate a throwaway fashion culture simply by existing. And even more!!! ASOS had been known to be stealing designs from small independent labels and printing out low-quality copies for a fraction of the price!!!",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=qWScQbHE51w&pp=ygUOQVNPUyB0aG91Z2h0cyA%3D,

Pretty basic selection with prices I wasn't too excited about. Found a great pair of jeans, but that was it. Then, I went to Chicago for school and found an actual TopShop store and was BLOWN AWAY.

10838,ASOS,comparison,"Shopping ASOS In Store vs. Online! * Which is better?! *+Random video idea,but the first outfit Drew was wearing instantly reminded me of the Sasha Bratz Genie Magic Doll, and it made me think what if you guys did a video recreating Bratz outfits irl? Because those dolls had style  it’d be cute to see how it looks on someone. You could do different looks, maybe one for each doll, and the last one could be a “Me if I was a Bratz doll” look and you do y’all’s own style OR have the person youre with in the video choose the outfits for each other. Or if not Bratz y’all could do the same but with Barbie outfits and It’d totally go with the Barbie movie when it comes out.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=XVUCuCutA8o&pp=ygUQQVNPUyBjb21wYXJpc29uIA%3D%3D,

I think Lucy suited the pink dress was very nice making me want it. I also think that colour green is very suited to you if you found it in something else but not that dress.

10854,ASOS,comparison,SIZE 6 vs SIZE 16 Try ON THE SAME OUTFITS!+I absolutely love Lucy's attitude to trying these outfits on - I find that even at Lucy's body curves (I'm an 18 and most of the outfits she tried were just like - 'Nope') - she was totally willing to go for it. Most of these outfits definitely suited Emily to a tea and she looks gorgeous in them. But I absolutely wholeheartedly agree with Lucy and her pain on 80% of these outfits - they're just not for curvier people and don't flatter her lovely figure. Gotta say though the first dress and the green dress ain't a vibe - but looked great on her! Would love to see Lucy's picks on her choice of outfits for her and Emily to try! xx,https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=mYrV95lOOh8&pp=ygUQQVNPUyBjb21wYXJpc29uIA%3D%3D,

10927,ASOS,comparison,The Best Quality Affordable Fashion Brands+Some mango pieces have lasted me 3-4 years. Since I entered and left University.

Either their larger sizes are immediately out of stock or they don't even bother making them. Or, their 2XL will fit like an L. Or, my favorite, the larger sizes will be significantly more expensive. There is a certain body type and size person most mid to high fashion want to wear their clothing.

My only choice was always Uniqlo, since their market is so height friendly (I'm 5'6'' only lol). And their quality is so above H&M, H&M's clothes don't last me at all. There's Muji as well, I'm not sure if they have stores from where you live tho, Harry.

In addition, H&M Group is not very ethical. Almost none of its supply chain is certified by labor standards which ensure worker health and safety, living wages or other labor rights.

11025,ASOS,comparison,"I BOUGHT THE MOST EXPENSIVE VS CHEAPEST OUTFIT ON ASOS!+The thing that people dont realize is that even though clothes look alike doesnt mean that you shouldnt buy the expensive one. The materials are often totally different and the little bit pricier items are much higher quality. The ”pricey” items on this video are not even that expensive, they are kinda middle-range in terms of the price. 110$ for shoes is not that much, I dont usually even buy shoes much cheaper than that because I know that they will not last as long. Today people are used to ordering clothes from wish for a dollar and ofcourse these better quality items are ”too expensive” for them.

11027,ASOS,comparison,"I BOUGHT THE MOST EXPENSIVE VS CHEAPEST OUTFIT ON ASOS!+If you decide to make a series out of this, i think you should check the quality difference between the ""expensive"" and ""cheap""... The plain white expensive shirt is from a heavy organic cotton and you can tell the difference with the almost translucent, thin cheap fabric, same case on the jacket and handbag... I don't agree with you and just go for the cheapest, quality is important and ethical sourcing too. Remember that when a piece of clothing is very cheap behind that usually there are workers who doesn't get paid the minimum wage... I like your video idea, but it can get better.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=C6WfHTYETTM&pp=ygUQQVNPUyBjb21wYXJpc29uIA%3D%3D,

You could do different looks, maybe one for each doll, and the last one could be a “Me if I was a Bratz doll” look and you do y’all’s own style OR have the person youre with in the video choose the outfits for each other.

We can’t buy a peice of clothing that was made perfectly with no problems. But be INTENTIONAL. If you buy thrifted clothes, make sure you don’t over consume. If you buy fast fashion, make sure you get maximum use out the piece. If you buy sustainable clothing, make sure you spend your money wisely.

Another thing about “ethical” brands is how....boring most of their clothing is. Why would I buy a plain white t-shirt for 70 bucks when I could easily find one at Goodwill for 5? If I look hard enough, I could probably find one that’s decent or good quality. My logic is: if I’m going to purchase something that’s brand new, it should be at least somewhat unique and difficult to find second-hand.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=Td9rHaEQsQA&pp=ygUXQVNPUyBldGhpY2FsbHkgc291cmNlZCA%3D,

11622,ASOS,ethically sourced,"why I'm starting to hate the sustainable fashion movement *let me explain*+It’s messed up that the sustainability movement has become so focused on individual behavior modification. It’s crippling to carry that weight when the choices we make as individuals seem to change so little. The responsibility does fall on the consumer, but it also falls on corporations and companies who continue to produce these items in careless excess. That is part of why we see so much waste, because more was made than we could possibly use at the time. In an ideal world, there would be more accountability at a corporate level, rather than isolating individuals and saddling them with sole responsibility. The information available is conflicting at times and therefore confusing. No one is doing it perfectly, and you don’t have to either. You’re doing enough, and if at some point you decide to do more, let it happen in it’s time. You’ll get burnt out trying to push yourself to check all the boxes right now, this minute, this month, this year. Especially when it’s unclear which boxes should be checked? Personal development takes time, so allow yourself that time.

11624,ASOS,ethically sourced,why I'm starting to hate the sustainable fashion movement *let me explain*+The biggest problem with sustainable fashion youtube channels is that they can come off kinda sanctimonious and shamey while still contributing to unnecessary amounts of consumerism.

So many people have that attitude towards sustainability! It’s such a gatekeepy mentality. When the whole point of the movement is to be wide-spread! Sustainability will only reach its ultimate goal if it’s able to catch on to everyone! It has to start with people making small changes because not many people are going to do a complete overhaul of their entire life. The best part about the movement is that there’s always at least one or two things that everyone can do to better their lives. Only a handful of people being 100% sustainable will not make more of a difference than thousands of people who are doing one thing differently and who are encouraging companies to change as well.

Let me explain - the majority of clothes I own are second hand or passed down from family, therefore, they don’t tend to reflect current fashion trends whereas modern sustainable clothing does. I find that this movement lacks the ability to bring something unpopular or out-of-date back into style, and so it leaves a lot of second hand clothing unused and unwanted. In short, what I’m trying to say is that people in general should try wearing more unpopular clothes, rather than sift through entire thrift stores trying to find a particular item of clothing which reflects current fashion trends.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=Td9rHaEQsQA&pp=ygUXQVNPUyBldGhpY2FsbHkgc291cmNlZCA%3D,

Miyazaki prefecture originally didn't have mangos, Okinawa was one of the very few prefectures that produced them. It all started when Shoichi Tate, a man from Miyazaki visited Okinawa and happened to eat some local mango. He was shocked at the flavor and when he went back to Miyazaki he decided he was going to try to grow some with 8 of his farming buddies. Things didn't go well for him and could barley grow a single fruit since they didn't even know how to pollinate the plant. They decided to rely on an Okinawan man, Ryokou Yara who who was the leader of mango studies in Okinawa. Yara didn't keep secrets and willingly taught the 8 men how to properly grow the fruit. Many of the Okinawan farmers hesitated to teach Miyazaki prefecture how to grow mangoes, but decided to anyway since Miyazaki was one of the few prefectures to let Okinawans evacuate to during WW2. Many older people who contributed to sharing the art said it was to in some way return the courtesy.

Miyazaki prefecture originally didn't have mangos, Okinawa was one of the very few prefectures that produced them. It all started when Shoichi Tate, a man from Miyazaki visited Okinawa and happened to eat some local mango. He was shocked at the flavor and when he went back to Miyazaki he decided he was going to try to grow some with 8 of his farming buddies. Things didn't go well for him and could barley grow a single fruit since they didn't even know how to pollinate the plant. They decided to rely on an Okinawan man, Ryokou Yara who who was the leader of mango studies in Okinawa. Yara didn't keep secrets and willingly taught the 8 men how to properly grow the fruit. Many of the Okinawan farmers hesitated to teach Miyazaki prefecture how to grow mangoes, but decided to anyway since Miyazaki was one of the few prefectures to let Okinawans evacuate to during WW2. Many older people who contributed to sharing the art said it was to in some way return the courtesy.

Miyazaki prefecture originally didn't have mangos, Okinawa was one of the very few prefectures that produced them. It all started when Shoichi Tate, a man from Miyazaki visited Okinawa and happened to eat some local mango. He was shocked at the flavor and when he went back to Miyazaki he decided he was going to try to grow some with 8 of his farming buddies. Things didn't go well for him and could barley grow a single fruit since they didn't even know how to pollinate the plant. They decided to rely on an Okinawan man, Ryokou Yara who who was the leader of mango studies in Okinawa. Yara didn't keep secrets and willingly taught the 8 men how to properly grow the fruit. Many of the Okinawan farmers hesitated to teach Miyazaki prefecture how to grow mangoes, but decided to anyway since Miyazaki was one of the few prefectures to let Okinawans evacuate to during WW2. Many older people who contributed to sharing the art said it was to in some way return the courtesy.

The real Philippine carabao mango that’s imported from the Philippines is very expensive. It’s funny how preferred consistency and texture develops according to what you’re used to. In the Philippines, we almost trash the Kent mango (we call apple mango) because to us, it tastes like medicine (cough syrup) and it’s too hard. It’s like imitation mango. Not the real thing only because it greatly differs from what we love more. Mangoes to us should have the consistency of ripe peach. Juicy and soft.

14887,Mango,ethically sourced,"Mango - Sustainable and responsible fashion brand+Fashion accounts for 10% of global carbon emissions. The whole point of fashion is to convince customers that they need to buy trends, consume, dump old clothes, and return the store to buy more. The only way for fashion to be truly sustainable if A) it is no longer trendy, and B) extremely long-lasting and durable. Mango clothing is very trendy and not durable. If Mango clothing were not trendy and very durable, then people would stop shopping at your stores. You would go out of business.",https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=NCcySp-QliQ&pp=ygUYTWFuZ28gZXRoaWNhbGx5IHNvdXJjZWQg,

I was always astounded by the dollar value of their suits/dresses in the few parties I attended because of her, but within themselves they didn't care. What they actually flaunted were bigger things like yatchs, private planes, or how some powerful business guy or politician invited them for dinner to another country or how they get special treatment when they walk into Swiss banks lol. It was a different world. You could very well be carrying a first copy LV bag and no one for would believe that it's not original, because that's not expected of anyone in that social setting. It's not a bag to flaunt anymore but just a norm on how you need to accessorize or carry yourself among those guys!!

(I’ll call him Bryan so it doesn’t get confusing when I mention the fairytale character.)  It is typical for film companies to try to please their audiences by finding actors and actresses that have decent likenesses to the beloved characters in the cartoon.  Imagine if Mulan were played by Gwyneth Paltrow!  People would be outraged, and rightfully so.  No film company would ever attempt anything so foolish.  The trouble is that nobody is allowed to be angry or upset by this casting, even though it is not okay.  There is racism, and then there is reverse racism.  Ariel Versace/Bryan Neele did nothing wrong.  Disney needs to respect their entire audience, not just one piece of it.

Within Canada there are several provinces, and each is run by a different premier. Unfortunately the person who was elected long before Covid has done a number on the people living here. There used to be limits on things like how much some landlords could legally increase the cost of rent while a tenant lived on the property, and that was largely done away with as far back as 2018. It’s been a nightmare, covid made it worse, and this post pandemic inflation is going to ruin us. People are at the point of stealing to be able to eat, and refusing to move if a landlord tries to evict them because there is nowhere to go.

I’m still on the fence about it, although it’s grown on me…. I just got a sample of the EDT and now understand the popularity. I think I like it better for not having such a cloying apple note. I believe I’d wear it much more. Definitely more versatile.

All of my assumptions before opening this video were confirmed to be true by the reviews. The EDT version definitely seems more bright and loud - I attribute that to the citrus opening being straight lemon instead of the candy apple. I'm a sucker for candy apple flavors, green or red...so I was definitely leaning toward the EDP from the get go. All of the other differences were also up my alley - overall just a safe purchase.

19626,Puma,popular,"How The PUMA Suede Became a Cultural Icon+Puma Suedes hold a special place in my heart. I was a kid during the break dance era of the 80’s, and it was all about Shell Toe Adidas or Puma Suedes. At least in my neighborhood, Puma was the go to shoe. More color ways meant more options to make an outfit with another item that was just as essential to B-Boys….colored Lee Jeans. The standard B-Boy outfit of the time in my hood was a Windbreaker, Colored Lees, and fat laced Puma Suedes. With either the Pumas or the fat laces color matched the Lees. My mom didn’t have much money back then so she only bought me the white leather Pumas with the black stripe instead of the suedes. I did get black fat laces though. So I pretty much was stuck with black and white fits for that time, lol. Now as an adult with my own cash, if I find a shoe I like. I buy 3 or 4 of its color ways.
