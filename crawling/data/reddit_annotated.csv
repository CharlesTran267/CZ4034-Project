"Nike,LV,Gucci,Zara,H&M,Calvin Klein","quality,price,haul","Replica Clothing Ruined Shopping for me A little back story to this post, I recently went on vacation in London and was excited to buy new clothes for my closet, I set out for one specific item, a pair of solid cargo pants; simple in concept but incredibly difficult to get a nice pair (I enjoy shopping more than the average Joe). I went to over 50 shops and genuinely could not find one pair of brown cargos that I could see myself rocking. I searched and searched: Zara, Bershka, Nike, Superdry, H&M, etc.; eventually I found a pair that I like just enough to justify the price asked. Just a couple hours later I loaded up  r/fashionreps and found an even nicer pair of Nike cargos; mind you the ones I bought are not even branded, and I spent almost 4 times the price compared to these ones.   Am I upset I spent much more? not at all, what it did to me however was realize how unrewarding purchasing ‚Äúreal‚Äù clothes is.   After this purchase I made it my mission to check the quality of designer and fashionable products and I was so taken aback. I found multiple Bape shirts going for almost 200¬£ and all had multiple stitching errors and loose strings. If someone is to spend unreasonable amounts of their wage on shirts or shoes or scarfs you‚Äôd think the quality would be perfect or the next best thing, but this is not the case. LV belts with loose buckles, Gucci wallets with awkward alignment, and St√ºssy shirts with crumbling print, almost half of what I saw had some flaw, mostly minor with a couple of extreme cases. Knowing that these high quality clothes were the same quality as budget batch replica‚Äôs,  what makes the price asked in stores justified?   Is it the branding? The convenience? The status ‚Äúearned‚Äù from handing your card over to the cashier in exchange for a nice item? Maybe the fact that the store has to pay utilities so they upscale everything?  You get crucified by ‚ÄúHype-Beasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúFashion-Gurus‚Äù when you ask about fakes but comparing the same pieces often is indistinguishable to almost everyone you‚Äôll meet. When you own replica clothes and just post fit pics not a soul will call it out, and if they do you can just delete the comment. In person it‚Äôs even more unlikely to get called out, people are lazy and often avoid unnecessary issues. Buying anything makes me think immediately of how much cheaper it would be to have it sent straight to the warehouse and has essentially put me off anything not directly from a manufacturer.  Calvin Klein underwear for 9‚Ç¨, you save 30. Chrome hearts sterling silver ring for 40‚Ç¨, you save a couple grand, supreme shirt for 15‚Ç¨, you save 80. You can buy beautiful jackets and shoes only Millionaires can afford and feel incredible about yourself without not being able to pay rent or afford food. It‚Äôs a confidence booster no matter which way you look at it, and a perk of the low prices is simply being able to experiment and choose different fits that would never be readily accessible with the ‚Äúreal deal‚Äù.  Every single item is like this, from the manufacturer it‚Äôs almost half or more ‚Äúoff‚Äù; and the budget batches save up to 90%. People say you get what you pay for and low price is low quality but hundreds of posts, videos, and reviews later it‚Äôs safe to say replicates hold their own much more than people outside this subreddit understand. It‚Äôs a cotton shirt vs a cotton shirt, not a cotton shirt vs a paper shirt. People understand reps as the Turkish Bazaar Reps where they make your skin yellow or the China town street vendors that charge eye watering prices for shoes with a lifespan of 2 weeks. It‚Äôs understandable that there is a stigma behind this niche of fashion but over the next few years we can expect a blow out in the fashion realm because with some extra cash, most items simply are 1:1; and people are always looking for a good deal.  I‚Äôd love to hear from y‚Äôall and maybe we can share some other experiences regarding how reps changed shopping. I‚Äôm still new to reps and have multiple hauls ready to be shipped out, but otherwise it seems like this is a common trend with most buyers.;;Real as fuck","{upvote:44,timestamp:2022-09-13}",Reddit,1,1

Cartier,price,"Cartier love bracelet and ring from Hlinjewelery After impatient wait the package arrived with Cartier love bracelet and ring in rose gold. Both had a set of branded bag, beautiful box and authenticity certificate.  Shipping: Shipping took 14 days directly from seller to Poland.   Communication: The sellers sells through WhatsApp and although I‚Äôm scared to buy directly it went smooth and without any problems.  The review part:  The bracelet weighs a LOT did not expect that much weight. The materials and production are great ofc it‚Äôs not real diamonds(zircon) for 65¬•(one with stones is 65¬•more than without) but either way it looks the same without a magnifying glass and experienced eye. The metal is really reflective and everyone that saw it thought it was gold.  It comes with a branded screwdriver made from the same metal. If you don‚Äôt know the bracelet it‚Äôs made that your partner has the screwdriver so you can‚Äôt take it off by yourself that‚Äôs where the name comes from. Though I was worried the screws are good and there is absolutely no wiggling.  On the inside there is engraving you can see on pictures but I don‚Äôt see any flaws.  The ring is from the same nice in touch and heavy metal. Since there is no moving parts i have much less to talk about but there is also engraving inside too. It‚Äôs just a solid ring but for the price it‚Äôs a steal.  Overall I‚Äôm really happy especially for the price. In two days I got like 7 complements about it.

,"quality,price,comparison","Busy Stone 40401 FLANK POCKET DOWN BOMBER Review + Comparison vs YC I bought both colorways of YC's 40401, and my busystone grey 40404 arrived today, so I thought I would make a review + comparison.  Review:   Busystone pays attention to detail, having all buttons facing the right direction, no lose threads, and the badge is crisp. The material is high quality, and worth the price. The box is came in was slightly damaged, but nothing worth complaining over. I'd give is a 9/10 overall.  &#x200B;  Comparison:  Busystone Badge:  [https://i.imgur.com/R5eh5Q2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/R5eh5Q2.jpg)   YC Badge:  [https://i.imgur.com/GAHqQqM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/GAHqQqM.jpg)   Badges side by side:  [https://i.imgur.com/D4RvjOy.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/D4RvjOy.jpg)   [https://i.imgur.com/HchGNj0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/HchGNj0.jpg)   YC's badge is slightly smaller than it's supposed to be, revealing some stitching. IMO not a big deal, but busystone nailed the placement and size.  Jackets side by side:  [https://i.imgur.com/2h9lk7A.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/2h9lk7A.jpg)   As you can see, YC has the wrong color for the drop pockets, as well as the reflective strip. The reflective strip and drop pockets are also smaller than they are supposed to be.   Jacket's reflective strips side by side:  [https://i.imgur.com/zGkVCrI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/zGkVCrI.jpg)   Busystone's strip is more vibrant as well as larger, but when comparing to retail, both are off.

,price,"[Guide] How To Order Prescription (Sun-)Glasses From Aooko / Jaron / Markin # Guide: How To Order Prescription (Sun-)Glasses From Aooko / Jaron / Markin  This guide is for everyone that previously had problems ordering (sun-)glasses from trusted seller, especially prescription glasses.  ## I - Introduction  After I've recently seen a lot of people struggling with ordering prescription glasses, I've decided to make this guide. Thanks to u/LetNo6981, u/Nemezis991 and u/armour- for inspiring me to make this as a post. This is the first time I'm writing a guide like this, so I'll appreciate any feedback and if you have any additional info, please let me know.  ## II - General Info  ## 1. Before Buying (Prescription)  If you want prescription glasses you need.. a prescription. Seems logical, but apparently not for everyone. *Please* make sure to get an up-to-date prescription from your local optometrist before considering to buy prescription glasses.  ## 2. Sellers  |Seller|Link|WhatsApp|WeChat| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Aooko|[https://aooko.x.yupoo.com/](https://aooko.x.yupoo.com/)|\+8615014016248|scoflic| |Jaron|[https://sheng6688.x.yupoo.com/](https://sheng6688.x.yupoo.com/albums)|\+8615012754632|\-| |Markin|[https://den1218.x.yupoo.com/](https://den1218.x.yupoo.com/)|\+8618823726241|\-|  This guide will primarly be about Aooko and Jaron, as I haven't ordered from Markin yet. However, it shouldn't matter too much, because it seems to work pretty much the same for all of them. Sunglasses legend u/daniboi007 ordered from every single one of them and posted lots of reviews, so make sure to look those up.  ## III - The Guide  ## 1. Search For The Glasses You Want  After you've read a few reviews, go to your seller of choice and search their yupoo albums. Click on ""All Categories"" at the top to search for specific brands.  If you're not sure if the glasses will fit you, you can compare measurements to your current frame. [Here's a good guide from eyebuydirect.com on how to do that](https://www.eyebuydirect.com/guides/frame-measurements). Search for the three little numbers on the inside of the temple of your glasses. Some may also refer to this section as the ""arm"" of your glasses. These three numbers are the frame's measurements.  For example: 48‚ñ°22 150 (48 = lens width, 22 = bridge with, 150 = temple length)  ## 2. Ordering Process - How To Order  1. Message the seller of your choice on WhatsApp or WeChat 2. Send them the link to their yupoo album of the glasses you want. Sometimes an album has multiple versions of the same pair of glasses. Tell them exactly which pair you want, or even better: make a screenshot an circle the pair you want. 3. &#x200B;    1. **Tell the seller you want them as prescription glasses** and send them screenshot of your prescription.    2. You can get pretty much every pair of glasses as sunglasses too (at least with Aooko and Markin. Not sure about Jaron). **Tell the seller you want them as prescription sunglasses**. If you order from aooko, just check his yupoo again. Under *(B) Protective lences*, you can choose from transition prescription lenses or sunglasses prescription lenses. Let him know what your preferred lens color and density is. Or - as before - make a screenshot and circle the lens you want. 4. The seller will check now if your order is possible to do and if he's got the glasses in stock. 5. If everything's okay the seller will tell you the price of the glasses and the prescription lenses. They will guide you through the rest of the process. The only thing left for you to do is choose between ordering via agent or directly to you. If you don't know how to use an agent, please check [the official guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/mlkvvn/2021_guide_fashionreps_guide_how_to_order_wegobuy/). Ordering via agent is *always* going to be the safer option, but you do whatever you want. I've also ordered directly from Aooko and Jaron before without any problems. 6. Ask the seller to send you QC Pictures before shipping the glasses to you. 7. Congratulations, you've ordered a pair of prescription (sun-)glasses!  ## IV - General Advice  I'm not in a position to tell you if these prescription glasses or sunglasses are safe to wear. The glasses I wear everyday are from a local optometrist, that I trust. But the back-up glasses and my sunglasses that I have from these sellers feel pretty much the same to me. If you're not sure or somethings not right when you get them, please go to your local optometrist and let them check the glasses out. If you don't trust these sellers with your prescription you can also simply order the frames from them and let your optometrist handle your prescription. Of course that's going to be more expensive, but that way your eyes are going to be safe and you've got the frames for cheap.  ## V - The End  **This is it for now. Please let me know if you've got any problems or if it's missing imporant info.**;;**Found Taobao/Weidian Links in Linked Post**  https://vetementsshop.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://den1218.x.yupoo.com/)  https://vssquanguopifa.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://stanleeow.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=529694454855  https://peltmc.x.yupoo.com/)  https://158sir.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://jyao888.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://js99999.x.yupoo.com/albums)  http://terryqiuyi.x.yupoo.com/)  https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=520537990040  https://blackcatstudio.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://steven-1989.x.yupoo.com/)  https://lanbo325.x.yupoo.com/)  https://x.yupoo.com/photos/xienian/albums)  https://listenuponlinestore.x.yupoo.com/albums)  http://aooko.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://amy04190419.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://houyw.x.yupoo.com/)  https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=536774208356  https://stan2021.x.yupoo.com/)  https://xinghaosp.x.yupoo.com/)  https://adidas-nike-jisuyundong.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://joystudio.x.yupoo.com/)  https://survivalsource.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://den1218.x.yupoo.com/  https://shopping007.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://highstreet.x.yupoo.com/albums)  http://wwujiao.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://feiyu1816.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://macseven.x.yupoo.com/albums)  http://loganhere.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://accessories888.x.yupoo.com/)  https://beanstudio88.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://konng-gonng.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://xiaozhi809466932.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://zengshuaige.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://finishline.x.yupoo.com/)  https://apple-reddit.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://husky-reps.x.yupoo.com/)  https://aooko.x.yupoo.com/  https://topacney.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://sheng6688.x.yupoo.com/  https://wenqiang1215.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://mangosneaker.x.yupoo.com/)  http://hansolo1.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=537202369958  https://aa800000000000.x.yupoo.com/)  http://zb25wt42.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://unionkingdom.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://hyperpeter.x.yupoo.com/)  https://jinlaifu888.x.yupoo.com/albums)  http://qualityproducts.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://to2dayclub.x.yupoo.com/)  https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=526937341226  https://henryreps.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://shoes654321.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://muksstore.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://lat-lon.x.yupoo.com/)  https://168shops.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://x.yupoo.com/photos/leozhag/albums)  https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=533702777962  https://xie16675.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://superstoney.x.yupoo.com/)  https://matchless-ken.x.yupoo.com/)  https://13570563632.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://naisan23.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://topstoney.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://manmanmore.x.yupoo.com/)  https://topgivenchyx.x.yupoo.com/)  https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=544172501531  https://sherryy.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://taylorback.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://cloyadstudio.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://hunter0824.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://hey-dog.x.yupoo.com/)  https://topmonclercn.x.yupoo.com/)  https://3125tiger.x.yupoo.com/albums)  https://2335499519.x.yupoo.com/)  https://iofferman.x.yupoo.com/albums?tab=gallery)  https://fakelab.x.yupoo.com/)  https://repsbrothers.x.yupoo.com/)  https://black--eyes.x.yupoo.com/)  https://topgivenchy.x.yupoo.com/)  **********  ^I ^am ^a ^[bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/k512f6/i_made_a_bot_to_link_to_missing_w2c_from_galleries) ^created ^by ^user ^'Albuyeh'. ^Send ^comments ^or ^whatever ^to ^him.","{upvote:5,timestamp:2022-05-13}",Reddit,0,

"Nike,Adidas",haul,"DO NOT SIZE UP ON LIN'S UB'S I'm not sure where this originated from. I'm going to do a follow up detailed haul review soon. I have 4 pairs of UB from lin:  4.0 trip black (real boost)  3.0 core black (real boost)  3.0 trip white (real boost)  1.0 cream (BASF)  &#x200B;  I am a TTS UK11 (EU(FR)46) in retail UB 4.0 for a snug fit and I ordered UK11 (EU(FR)46) in all pairs, the 4.0 and 1.0 fit nicely due to the tight knit (they are a bit bigger than retail but because of the tight knit it holds your foot in place and doesn't leave loads of room at the end)  &#x200B;  Both pairs of 3.0 are too big, there is more than a thumb worth of room at the ends of the shoes. For the core blacks it's not really an issue because the knit kind of holds my foot in place and they're comfy af, but the trip white's knit is looser and wider meaning my foot flops around in them a bit. I definitely could've gone .5 or 1 size down in both the 3.0's.  &#x200B;  I've seen too many reviews where people say they were told to size up and now they're too big. Hopefully this post will save a few people from making the same mistake.  &#x200B;  Edit: It is important to note here that I am referencing my TTS to RETAIL UB 4.0 and not Nike or Vans etc. It seems a lot of the confusion has come from people comparing their TTS in another shoe to Adidas. Sizing is often different across different brands or models of shoe. If you are unsure of your size in UB, you can go into most shoe shops and try on a pair of 4.0 or UB19's to find out your size.  &#x200B;  Update: I measure the heel to toe on the insides of all 4 pairs and my retail EQT's as well as correlating with the adidas heel-toe/size measurements on their website. All 4 pairs are roughly 0.5-1 cm bigger than retail adidas (aka 0.5-1 size bigger than retail).  The reason the 4.0 and 1.0 don't feel too big is because of the much tighter knit which secures your foot and leaves a smaller gap at the front of the shoe.;;I second this. Had to buy another pairs because I sized up.","{upvote:2,timestamp:2019-05-22}",Reddit,0,

I ended up adding a couple of other small things (the hat + socks) and my overall package weight was 3,514g (:/) so I ended up paying for the next tier of EMS shipping. Overall I'm very happy with my first haul.

Strap in, I accidentally wrote an essay.  In total, I spent about 320 Canadian [CERB bucks](https://i.imgur.com/7cGAOMM.jpg) on this haul, including shipping. I‚Äôm pretty happy with that.  &#x200B;  **Stats**:  |Height|6‚Äô1‚Äù| |:-|:-| |Weight|180lbs|  &#x200B;  **Shipping**:  |Method|GD-EMS| |:-|:-| |My location:|Ontario, Canada| |Estimated weight|4515g| |Actual weight|3960g| |Shipping deposit|Ôø•617| |Actual shipping cost|Ôø•517| |Shipping time from submitting the parcel on WGB to arriving at my door:|\~15 days|  &#x200B;  ## Stone Island Sweater:  **WTC**: [https://imgur.com/a/jlfFL2P](https://imgur.com/a/jlfFL2P)  **Brand**: Stone Island  **Item**: 18FW 63420 LOGO CREWNECK SWEATSHIRT  **Price**: Ôø•200  **Warehouse weight**: 565g  **Size**: XL  **QC pics**: [https://imgur.com/a/qjC50Gf](https://imgur.com/a/qjC50Gf)  **In-hand pics**: [https://imgur.com/a/lZOSE4A](https://imgur.com/a/lZOSE4A)  This is without a doubt, the best fitting longsleeve I‚Äôve ever owned. It‚Äôs a nice comfortable material and feels extremely solid. Stitching is, as far as I can tell, perfect. The badge is great, the color is totally accurate. TopStoney could be charging double for this and I‚Äôd still buy it again (please don‚Äôt tell him this)  I also bought 2 extra badges from stoney, one regular and one ghost. This sweater looks great with the ghost badge and a pair of all black pants. Idk if it‚Äôs harem to mix n match SI tags, but it looks good.  **10/10**, flawless  &#x200B;  ## Cav Empt Sweater  **WTC**: [https://imgur.com/a/Z77m9qn](https://imgur.com/a/Z77m9qn)  **Brand**: Cav Empt  **Item**: Tokyo Starry Night Sweater  **Price**: Ôø•80  **Warehouse weight**: 532g  **Size**: XL  **QC pics**: [https://imgur.com/a/xJmsy1Q](https://imgur.com/a/xJmsy1Q)  **In-hand pics**: [https://imgur.com/a/IueBOgX](https://imgur.com/a/IueBOgX)  Pretty good. Really can‚Äôt complain much for 80yuan, but I‚Äôm going to anyway. I started this post off with the TopStoney, so everything else will be compared to that standard.  Stitching is mediocre. A lot of dangly thread-ends on the inside, and seams seem weak, like they might tear if pulled on. The threading on the rubber badge is fucked in one area, but it's attached solidly, so I‚Äôm not going to try to fix it. The print on the outside is decent, but it's shifted off-center a bit on both the front and the back. Hard to notice unless you‚Äôre looking for it though, so I‚Äôm not really upset. Material isn‚Äôt as thick as the topstoney, but it‚Äôs definitely decent. Fits great for being Cav Empt on a tall baka gaijin.  The ‚Äútag‚Äù on the inside is enormous. Very pleasantly surprised by that. The print quality on the upper ‚Äú\[C\] \[E\] Made In Japan‚Äù part sucks, but it‚Äôs the tag, who gives a shit.  **7/10**  &#x200B;  ## Palace NHS Tshirt  **WTC**: [https://imgur.com/a/vpQOepD](https://imgur.com/a/vpQOepD)  **Brand**: Palace  **Item**: Palace ‚ÄúNHS TRI-TO HELP‚Äù Tshirt  **Price**: Ôø•98  **Warehouse weight:** 300g  **Size**: XL  **QC pics**: [https://imgur.com/a/pt1VZ4T](https://imgur.com/a/pt1VZ4T)  **In-hand pics:** [https://imgur.com/a/BVE7E9a](https://imgur.com/a/BVE7E9a)  It‚Äôs a great quality tee with a good quality print on it. A few people in another QC thread were saying the front print looks crooked, but I can‚Äôt tell. Fits a bit big on me, I should have ordered a L, but a trip through a warm washing machine should sort that out.  **10/10**  &#x200B;  ## Alyx Belt  **WTC**: [https://imgur.com/a/4ygiSCG](https://imgur.com/a/4ygiSCG)  **Brand:** Alyx  **Item**: Alyx Belt, black on black.  **Price**: Ôø•48  **Warehouse weight**: 155g  **QC pics**: [https://imgur.com/a/rChwoUP](https://imgur.com/a/rChwoUP)  **In-hand pics**: [https://imgur.com/a/zf5nv5B](https://imgur.com/a/zf5nv5B)  I wasn‚Äôt totally sold on this one when I bought it. I‚Äôd heard about people struggling to feed it through belt-loops, being too long, but after wearing it for a day on various different pants/shorts, I have to say: none of these are issues.  The buckle feeds through every belt loop I threw at it just fine. And just leaving the extra \~2 feet of belt hang down is a fire look.  The buckle itself is super high quality. Feels like a solid piece of machined metal. The snap mechanism is really satisfying to use. Tightening it is as easy as pulling on the belt.  The one issue I have is that it loosens pretty easily, but it never loosens to the point of comprising functionality. My pants stay up, so its doing its job.  I‚Äôm a little concerned the black paint will begin scratching off, but honestly that‚Äôll probably just add to the overall tech aesthetic.  High quality materials, feels great in hand. Good belt.  **9/10**  &#x200B;  ## Stone Island Shorts  **WTC**: [https://imgur.com/a/WcmBaJp](https://imgur.com/a/WcmBaJp)  **Brand:** Stone Island  **Item**: Shadow Project L0308 Bermudas Shorts  **Price**: Ôø•45  **Warehouse weight**: 216g  **Size**: XL  **QC pics:** [https://imgur.com/a/QIjSlrP](https://imgur.com/a/QIjSlrP)  **In-hand pics**: [https://imgur.com/a/F7CrShD](https://imgur.com/a/F7CrShD)  They‚Äôre cheap, and didn‚Äôt weigh much, but holy shit these are poor quality. They fit well, but feel like if I move my legs wrong they‚Äôll rip in half. There‚Äôs two buttons above the front zipper, and one of them fell off as I was putting them on for the first time. The material is extremely thin. Not enough to see through, but enough to feel weak.  The zippers on the side feel fine, but require two hands to zip up, which is awkward.  The Shadow Project badge isn‚Äôt as horrible as I was expecting, but it still isn‚Äôt great. Loose threads everywhere, thread-ends are flying all over the place, inside and out.  The threading along the belt loops is sloppy and inconsistent.  They don‚Äôt look awful enough for me to regret buying them, but if they last me till the end of summer I'll be surprised.  **4/10**  &#x200B;  ## Rhude Shorts  **WTC**: [https://imgur.com/a/9lLPMwT](https://imgur.com/a/9lLPMwT)  **Brand**: Rhude  **Item**: Shorts, Black Shanghai Exhibition Limited Edition  **Price**: Ôø•99  **Warehouse weight**: 258g  **Size**: XL  **QC pics:** [https://imgur.com/a/vs1vUab](https://imgur.com/a/vs1vUab)  **In-hand pics**: [https://imgur.com/a/PVwkiFz](https://imgur.com/a/PVwkiFz)  These feel really high quality. Stitching looks great, zips feel excellent, and the drawstring feels solid. The material is shiny and mostly water resistant. The print is pretty good - a few flaws, but nobody will be getting close enough to these to ever notice, and I don‚Äôt personally care.  They fit perfectly. Extremely comfortable, breathable and soft on the inside.  I saw a QC where the metal piece at the end of one of the drawstrings fell off, so I‚Äôm going to pour some superglue or epoxy in the gap to keep that from happening to mine.  I will be buying these again in my next haul.  **9/10**  &#x200B;  ## Carhartt Cargo Pants  **WTC**: [https://imgur.com/a/V9Aat06](https://imgur.com/a/V9Aat06)  **Brand**: Carhartt  **Item**: WIP Cargo Pants (Pretty sure these are fantasy)  **Price**: Ôø•115  **Warehouse weight**: 523g  **Size**: XL  **QC pics**: [https://imgur.com/a/yCqXTHW](https://imgur.com/a/yCqXTHW)  **In-hand pics**: [https://imgur.com/a/jt5AwlQ](https://imgur.com/a/jt5AwlQ)  They‚Äôre OK! The sizing chart says they should be 104cm tall, but by my measurement, they‚Äôre closer to 99. The material feels durable, the stitching is good, but a lot of sloppy thread ends on the inside. The drawstrings feel flimsy and fragile, but so far have done a good job of holding the pants up on me.  The fit is alright. I wouldn‚Äôt mind a few more cm in height, but I went for a walk in them yesterday and had no issues with comfort.  **8/10**  &#x200B;  ## Nike Cargo Pants  **WTC**: [https://imgur.com/a/yOXDFPz](https://imgur.com/a/yOXDFPz)  **Brand**: Nike  **Item**: Fantasy Cargo Joggers  **Price**: Ôø•94  **Warehouse weight**: 518g  **Size**: XL  **QC pics**: [https://imgur.com/a/kxjHNTJ](https://imgur.com/a/kxjHNTJ)  **In-hand pics**: [https://imgur.com/a/gbpP9pp](https://imgur.com/a/gbpP9pp)  They don‚Äôt fit. At all. Can barely move my legs while I‚Äôm wearing them. Its a combination of the waist size being too small, and them being too short. Really should have gone with the XXL, but even that might not have been enough.  Says 98cm height, in hand they‚Äôre 94cm.  If they fit, these would be nice pants. They‚Äôre made of a rugged feeling outer, and a really soft inner lining that feels great. The drawstring is similar to the Carhartts - kinda flimsy, but not awful. The stitching on this piece is good. Nothing concerning. The pockets are made of this nice white silky fabric.  The badge on the left pocket is dumb gibberish. ‚ÄúEASYFITTING ANO LASTING VALUE‚Äù  Giving these an **8/10**  because it's not really their fault I didn‚Äôt size up properly.  &#x200B;  ## Palace Line Stripe TShirt  **WTC**: [https://imgur.com/a/AIiav1B](https://imgur.com/a/AIiav1B)  **Brand**: Palace  **Item**: 18SS Palace Line Stripe T-Shirt  **Price**: Ôø•58  **Warehouse weight:** 242g  **Size**: M  **QC pics**: [https://imgur.com/a/dmpmBKh](https://imgur.com/a/dmpmBKh)  **In-hand pics:** [https://imgur.com/a/MCmeKtW](https://imgur.com/a/MCmeKtW)  Bought this for my friend, so the fit pic is gonna be fucked, but I included anyway because maybe you‚Äôre a 6‚Äô1‚Äù guy who wants a slightly tight shirt.  Great quality shirt. Feels solid. The print is great as well. Hard to go wrong with a printed tee. They went the extra mile and printed this before sewing, as the graphic wraps around under the bottom of the shirt, which is a great touch.  Seriously nothing wrong with this at all.  **10/10**  &#x200B;  ## Patagonia TShirt  **WTC**: [https://imgur.com/a/GIVSqYa](https://imgur.com/a/GIVSqYa)  **Brand**: Patagonia  **Item**: Patagonia Logo Tshirt  **Price**: Ôø•29  **Warehouse weight:** 153g  **Size**: M  **QC pics:** [https://imgur.com/a/ADE6aSD](https://imgur.com/a/ADE6aSD)  **In-hand pics:** [https://imgur.com/a/HWukI4U](https://imgur.com/a/HWukI4U)  Another bought for my friend.  It‚Äôs a cheap-ass gildan with a plastisol graphic on it. What do you expect, its 29 fucking yuan.  The white is pretty transparent - will definitely expose your nips. Get the black if you‚Äôre worried about that.  The tag says Gildan on it, so there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôre going to pass an LC (but its patagonia lol who cares).

Can‚Äôt find any problems with this one at all. Stitching could maybe be a bit tighter on the compartments in the interior, but that's really nit-picking.  The text on the front has a bit of that 3M action going on.  I don‚Äôt know enough about bags to give this a proper review - this is another one going to my friend.  **9/10**  &#x200B;  **What did we learn:**  1. Don‚Äôt buy extremely cheap shit or shit you‚Äôre not sure you really want. This seems obvious, but shipping is such a huge fraction of the total haul cost, you might as well be spending that money on moving things you can actually wear. Wish I‚Äôd spent another 50yuan on those Stone Island shorts and got something I can be excited about. 2. Spend more time looking at sizing. I ordered 2 mediums tees for my smaller friend, and an XL for myself. His mediums fit me way better than the XL. I figured a chinese XL would be like an L, but boy was I wrong. I can probably put it through a cycle in the wash to size it down, but that‚Äôs always risky. Anyway if i‚Äôd just looked at the sizing chart instead of just assuming it would be smaller, my Palace tee wouldn‚Äôt be a Palace dress. 3. Sizing on pants is all over the fucking place. The Nikes were 4-5cm too short, and the Carhartts were a bit off as well. I‚Äôd figured sizing up too much might be too big around the waist, but I guess they just don't sell clothes for bigger people in china, as their largest sizes seem to fit my 33US waist just fine.;;Nice review! Do you think the Rhude shorts are the same batch as 3125tiger and the other sellers? I bought the same from them and it wasn‚Äôt as comfortable as expected, also the material was stiff","{upvote:1,timestamp:2020-08-19}",Reddit,1,0

Originally, I wanted the denim nylon jacket, but that was sold out, and after lockdowns eased, he shipped it out with delay and details were off so I RL‚Äôd. I didn‚Äôt know at the time I bought and even shipped it out that it was worn by Jason Lee on Drink Champs, so I was going off of reference pictures online and that was it.  - Jacket is made out of denim is surprisingly thick. I haven‚Äôt worn a denim jacket since I was a kid so I might just be missing out, but the heaviness on this is nice and is pretty good for a breezy Spring or Fall day with a tee underneath. Probably won‚Äôt be ideal for anything less than 50¬∞F / 10¬∞C with just a long sleeve/crewneck underneath  - This is definitely oversized, and at my stats with a size 2, I can layer up with an oversized hoodie underneath, and still have some wiggle room. Sizing down once I think would‚Äôve been okay, but I was afraid the arms would be a little short. I find size 2 okay, and don‚Äôt regret sizing up to be safe. However, for potential buyers, if you‚Äôre around my stats, unless you‚Äôre looking for an overly baggy fit, size 1 would be perfect.  - This jacket is supposed to have a washed/distressed look to it, and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs intentional or not, but if you look at the ‚Äòwhite stripes‚Äô on the jacket, it looks like they tossed the jacket on the floor, ran it over a few times, then dragged it across the garage floor before shipping it out to my agent to give it that distressed feel (that or it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs been worn for 12 days by hundreds of people at JFK). In one of the pictures, I had a piece of computer paper next to it for reference. I think washing it should help lighten it up a little if it‚Äôs just from manufacturing, but at the same time, I‚Äôm not too worried about it since after a few washes, it might end up like that anyways if it was pure white. It's a pretty coarse denim, but with wear it‚Äôll definitely soften up. **EDIT:** Washed the jacket, and the white stripes have turned a darker grey after washing it in a cycle of darks. Not bothered by it since it'll be worn and washed, and pretty sure the genuine article would be the same after a few washes anyways.   - The front pockets and inner pocket are zipper lined and have some decent depth. The inner pocket unfortunately doesn‚Äôt have that big of an opening so you can‚Äôt put your whole hand in there, but it can easily fit your phone and you can fish it out easily. Front pockets again are zipper lined, has good depth to it and would help keep your hands out of the cold, and also your small items from falling out. The main zipper is a little stiff and you have to fidget with it a little bit but not a big deal for me.   - The sleeves and waist area look and feel a little weird, but comparing it to pictures online, it‚Äôs actually similar to how they look in retail. They‚Äôre elastic but sort of a stiff elastic and looks like an overly stretched elastic that only really scrunches up at some parts. I might swing by the Balenciaga store on my off day to see if they have it there just to see the real deal myself since I essentially bought this piece blind just going off of pictures online. The embroidery is a little funky, but I‚Äôm not too concerned as long as there‚Äôs no visible thread linking each letter, but I‚Äôll also take a look versus retail.   - **Verdict: 9/10** Overall am satisfied with the purchase. It‚Äôs a great piece for the Spring and Fall, or if you just live in 50-60¬∞F weather year-round as a light jacket. The jacket has weight but it‚Äôs not heavy enough to be a winter jacket by any means (unless you layer up 3-4 layers underneath. Oversized but not overbearing since the ‚Äòelastic‚Äô actually does a good job of cuffing your waist and wrists. I usually pack very light so having additional pockets and even an inner pocket would help lighten the load on my pants. The inner pocket could actually fit a power bank to top up my phone if I need. This piece isn‚Äôt as loud as some of the others from Balenciaga and I appreciate that.  | Fear of God FG Crewneck Sweatshirt (Premium Gray and Camel) | Size: Large | 710g each | Ôø•168 each +Ôø•8 shipping | Singor |[Yupoo](https://steven-1989.x.yupoo.com/albums/101774132?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=3018541) // [TaoBao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=653498860145)| [QC](https://imgur.com/a/B7I0bjM) // [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/7Gh8vZa) // [On](https://imgur.com/a/o5LArHp)| [Sizing Chart](https://i.imgur.com/4VH8rEj.jpg) |  |:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|  - I‚Äôve seen crewnecks with front pockets/pouches before and thought it was pretty novel. I don‚Äôt own any like that and Singor has left a good impression on me his fleece products with the Yeezy sweatpants so I just went for it. They were actually in pre-production when I first ordered it.  - These are slightly to oversized. If you look at the pictures on the Yupoo, the FOG model pic has them wearing a hoodie UNDERNEATH the sweatshirt. I thought maybe during the breezier days, I can probably wear a Gildan crewneck underneath it for something to layer up and skip the jacket, or just wear it lounging around or whatever, so I sized up because of that. I think going down with TTS medium would be a better fit and it‚Äôll be less baggy, but I‚Äôd prefer the baggier fit to have a little more flexibility.  - These crewnecks are fleece lined on the inside, and inside the kangaroo pouch as well, so suffice to say, it‚Äôs going to be warm. I wore the camel crewneck with a long sleeve Uniqlo Heat-Tech underneath and it was great for the 50¬∞F weather even with the breeze. The cuffs at the wrist and waist are a bit loose, probably because of the sizing, but it‚Äôs a more relaxed fit anyways so if you like a tighter cuff, I would go true to size.   - If you look at the neck opening, the sizing is different between the two colors. Not sure if this is intentional or not, but the premium gray one would allow you to wear a hoodie and whatnot underneath since the opening is large enough. The camel one wouldn‚Äôt allow for that and I don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt catch it in the QC pics but I have room to work with when layering now and that‚Äôs fine by me. The premium gray one is also softer to the touch than the camel one as well, but overall, both are soft and comfy.  - **Verdict: 9/10** Something new to me, but still playing it safe. It‚Äôs still a bit chilly here so it came in just in time to be worn a few more times before the tee shirt weather hits. For the price, it‚Äôs more than worth it (I would buy it as blanks as well for the same quality too if Singor sold it as it is). Assuming this applies to each and every gray piece Singor makes, I would recommend the premium gray colorway any day just for how soft it is to the touch, even softer than the camel one.    #The RL  | Balenciaga Denim Nylon Jacket | Size: 38 | 727g | Ôø•459 +Ôø•10 shipping | Cloyad | [Yupoo](https://cloyad0809.x.yupoo.com/albums/100441225?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=3687672) // [TaoBao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=649862622296) | [QC](https://imgur.com/a/HeFqBuc) | [Sizing Chart](https://i.imgur.com/crEEfOz.jpg) | |:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|  - Originally, I wanted to get this piece from Cloyad, but the lockdown threw a wrench in that plan and he removed it from his Yupoo and was sold out. They came back in stock and I went with one but was disappointed.   - Obvious flaws right off the bat for me was the fact that the N and C are far from the zipper lining for the logo. It‚Äôs also pretty obvious too from a distance since the letters are on white. The second is that the logo isn‚Äôt centered. If you look at the shot with the ruler, you can see it‚Äôs drifting down.   - Not sure how these were before the lockdown, but considering Cloyad is one of the better choices for Balenciaga, this was disappointing. His size chart did not look it does now, and it looked just like Rick‚Äôs size chart and stock photos. Coincidentally both of them dropped this jacket from their Yupoo page at the same time, and Rick hasn‚Äôt added it back to his Yupoo, so I‚Äôm leaning towards them using the same source for the jacket, and Cloyad is now using a different source that‚Äôs not up to par with his previous source.","{upvote:54,upvoteRatio:0.96,timestamp:2022-04-29}",Reddit,0,

The arms are a bit stiff but I prefer that to my old broken floppy arms that are moulding under the plastic. I'm sure they will break in after regular use. The shape looks good. The weight feels good and doesn't feel like a Poundland (Dollar Store) special. I wouldn't have noticed the font difference unless my old sunglasses were next to them. What do you think?  I think I never need to buy a real pair again. I might have to branch out to some of the other brands like YSL, Chanel or Gucci, but he told me himself the Ray-Bans are always in stock and his most popular.

Hi all fam everyone knows that the situation of pandemic is getting more and more serious world wide and as a seller there is so limited we could do except donating medical surgical masks to ppl who need it. Till now we have totally donated over 10,000 pieces medical surgical masks world wide and as long as we don‚Äôt go bankrupt, we will continue to donate. Today we decide to continue this donation of 5000 pieces medical surgical masks in this community please read this post if you need masks.  **Q: What is the requirements to enroll in this donation, what is minimum rep purchased amount in order to have free medical surgical masks?**  You need to spend at least $900 in my shop to get qualification for this donation. Lmao 1:1 joking dude! You  don't have to purchase anything from me to get these free medical surgical masks, simply select qty as 1 before proceed to next step on my web site.  **Q: How many pieces I can have in this donation and can I pay for additional masks if I want more?**  Each fam can have **20 pieces(1 pack)** medical surgical masks for free in this donation and if you want more please use your own source to purchase for I will not sell any masks to anyone within this donation, logic is simple I am a seller so even I offer cost price quotation still some ppl will think not cheap enough, in order to avoid unnecessary or potential blame I would rather donate 20 pieces per person than selling. Second reason is I admit that 99.99% ppl in this fam are nice and honest but still there are extremely small number of people would markup the price a lot of donated masks and resell to other ppl. Same as some ppl would resell my reps as retail out of this sub. Check this post if you want to know more.

I bet you guys won't head to those area and if you are medical staff please DO NOT accept my medical surgical masks donation, use N95 mask only !

Chanel,"quality,comparison","Perfume Guy (Chez Pierre) - 15 Fragrance Review G'day repfam,  Over the past few months I have purchased 15 fragrances from u/peracar00. I thought I would write a review as I was greatly assisted by the informative reviews that have been posted in the past.  # Experience  **Communication + Shipping**  The purchase, communication, and shipping experience is really straightforward. Chez's website is easy to use, he responds quickly to emails, and the shipping to Australia was relatively quick (around 3 weeks) given how far away Serbia is. You can definitely trust Chez to deliver and I would highly recommend him for those interested in replica fragrances  **Customer Service**  I have ordered twice so far, and in both packages Chez has included some cool little fragrance samples. In my most recent package, in addition to a couple of sample fragrances, Chez included a gift fragrance - 30ml bottle I think - at absolutely no charge! It was 'Tuxedo' (Layton) which I was looking at purchasing anyway, so this was an awesome surprise and just one example of Chez's exceptional customer service.  **Minor Complaint**  My only complaint would be that in the second package, there was some minor leaking in a few of the fragrances because the lids weren't screwed on properly. This didn't happen with the first shipment but there were about 4 in the second shipment that appeared to have leaked because the lids weren't secured appropriately. Lost Cherry was the worst with about 10-15% of the bottle gone but the rest was just minor. It did make the bottles a bit greasy though!  # Fragrance Ratings  Now to the part that you actually care about: do they actually smell any good?  In summary, yes!  **Approach**  I have seen previous reviews which, for some incomprehensible reason, review the fragrances based on how 'good' the fragrances smell as opposed to how close they compare to the retail versions. This is unhelpful because:  1. fragrances are extremely subjective and while ratings may be illustrative, they are certainly not demonstrative of a fragrance's quality because each individual will be attracted to different smells; 2. blind buying fragrances is already a dangerous game, so ratings of replica fragrances on scent is even less reliable; and 3. this is a sub for replicas, ergo the the prima facie position should be to review the fragrance's comparison to the real version rather than on its own merits.  Consequently, this review will focus on how close each fragrance smell to retail. It's relatively easy to determine whether you like the scent or not by simply going down to your local perfume retailer, rather than trust my subjective opinion  That being said, I will still describe the fragrance in case people need some inspiration!  **Fragrance Ratio**  All fragrances were a 1:3 ratio in glass bottles; I think anything stronger than this would be olfactory assault. This means that every single one of these bad boys lasts forever and projects well too. This is especially beneficial where the retail version of a fragrance is notorious for its weak staying power.  One spray on the neck is normally enough for me and skin scent is often present more than 12 hours later.  **Tobacco Vanille: 9.5/10**  Warm, spicy, with a smooth vanilla on the dry down. The tobacco does not smell synthetic and absolutely carries this scent. I think the rep might be a tad spicier on the opening but after 15 minutes the difference is unnoticeable.  **Virgin Island Water: 7/10**  As many people have noted before, this is a scent that just oozes beach holiday vibes. Lime and coconut are the two dominant notes in this one, so definitely a more causal fragrance.  I think the lime is a little more synthetic than the OG, and I don't think it captures the rum that differentiates the OG from pure sun tan smell. I still really like it and the dry down smells a lot more similar. The best part is that it lasts forever, unlike Creed's VIW.  **Aventus: 9/10**  I was definitely ready to be disappointed by this, but was pleasantly surprised. My main concern was that the smoky pineapple note would be difficult to replicate and that it was just smell like a generic freshy or an air freshener.  The opening has all the citrus and pineapple of the OG, but dries down into the smokey delight that most people associate Aventus with. I actually got a compliment with this one from one of the players I coach for basketball when he came back to the bench - not exactly the normal compliment scenario but it just smells good!  **Oud Wood: 7.5/10** (but for me a 9.5/10)  A fresh yet dark woody fragrance that is clean enough to wear in the office but masculine enough that you know something different is going on. I think this one is actually a bit more smokey than the OG...and I kind of like it?  The OG is a little fresher than this but the rep isn't heavy or cloying by any means. I honestly prefer this to the OG as it smells a bit earthier/smokier and closer to that oud note.  **Green Irish Tweed: 8.5/10**  This smells like rolling green hill in the Irish countryside - I've never been to Ireland, but this has to be what it smells like.  Such a fresh, green fragrance, this is not a casual fragrance and is quite masculine. The OG is a little smoother but this one holds up well.  **Tuscan Leather: 9.5/10**  The most luxurious leather jacket/handbag/wallet etc. you've ever smelled. Leather is by far the most dominant note here but the raspberry really helps to avoid just smelling like a straight up cowhide. Bit of vanilla underneath as well which adds to the luxury. This smells pretty damn close to retail.  A winter fragrance because wearing this in the summer would probably suffocate people.  **Mill√©sime Imp√©rial: 8.5/10**  I don't really like aquatics. They're generic and have been done a million times over.  This aquatic? I like this aquatic.  A fresh but sophisticated scent, the salty accords bring the ocean straight to your nostrils...but only if the ocean was also wearing a sharp linen suit. The woody notes, musk, and iris prevent this one from becoming another freshy mess, and the notes are blended so smoothly; its like a much more grown-up, sophisticated Nautica Voyage.  I think this one is a little bit fruitier than the OG but still quite close.  **D&amp;G The One: 10/10**  This one was free mini sample in my first shipment. I like the smell of the retail but it simply does not last long enough.  This one smells exactly like the retail, but lasts forever. What more could you want?  **Wood Sage &amp; Sea Salt: 10/10**  This scent just screams expensive. Jo Malone creates great fragrances that provide a subtle hint of sophistication and this dupe absolutely reflects that.  The earthiness of the sage and the fresh mineral and ocean scents will make this perfect for summer. A more refined scent with great longevity that will definitely warrant a refill.  **Lost Cherry: 8/10**  Smells like a sweet but dirty cherry. I know there are other notes in this but the cherry is so prominent (as you might hope).  I think retail is a tad less synthetic, but the dry down cancels that out.  **Soleil Blanc: 7/10**  A coconut, bergamot and ylang-ylang fusion. Very summery, almost like a feminine partner to Creed Virgin Island Water.  This smells great but I feel that the ylang-ylang in this is a more overpowering than in retail and that can be distracting.  **Coco Mademoiselle: 8/10**  A very convincing dupe for the real scent. Delivers on the fresh floral notes that Chanel is known for with minimal synthetic undertones.  This is one of the more traditional scents of the bunch and was executed very well.  **Black Orchid: 9/10**  The retail version of this scent is so unique, I wasn't sure that the dupe could capture the luxury in its fullness.  I was happily proven wrong. The warm top notes, floral middle notes and sweet fruity undertones were executed extremely well. The scent lasts easily all day and is now my wife's go-to evening scent.  **Layton: ?** (mine is 9/10)  I haven't smelled the retail version of this fragrance so my opinion probably isn't very helpful. I have, however, read a few reviews that seem to match up to what this smells like. Bit of a menthol in the opening but it dries down to this sweet and spicy concoction that reminds me of an apple pie. I pick up in vanilla, apple, probably mint, and a whole bunch of great spices.  **Givenchy Pi: ???**  Honestly, no idea. Never smelled the original and haven't made my mind up about this one. Very fresh.  # Conclusion  I was extremely impressed with the quality of fragrances that I received from Chez. As someone who really enjoys fragrances but wouldn't dream of wasting my money on some of the more luxury fragrances, Chez provides an accessible and affordable alternative.   I would definitely recommend purchasing.;;Tobacco vanille is just the way to go","{upvote:3,timestamp:2021-12-18}",Reddit,1,1
Chanel,"quality,price,haul","[REVIEW] Chanel Medium Classic Flap bag | Part 02 Haul Hey guys! Thank you for the good comments on my last review. Making this review feels nostalgic. I know we've missed repladies so much and my sister and I missed them too. :( This is my part 02 haul still from Leo. It's a Chanel Classic bag featuring my sister's hands in the picture below haha! There's going to be more personal reviews soon and I hope you guys enjoy!  **Seller Information:**   **Name:** Leo   **WeChat:** Leo\_bag588   **WhatsApp:** \+86 19120637469   **Shipping Method:** ARAMEX   **Price + Shipping Fee:** 1450CNY + 280CNY = 1730 CNY (Approximately 256 USD)  **My Pictures:** [CHANEL Medium Classic flap bag](https://imgur.com/a/JLUAauV)   **Quality: 10/10**   I'm going to be honest, the quality of this bag went beyond our expectations. I wouldn't say it was a cheap purchase considering its price. Everything seemed almost perfect!   **Comfortability: 9/10**   The chain of the Chanel bag doesn't feel painful and it doesn't stain on my sisters clothes after sometime usage. It doesn't feel heavy so rest assured your shoulders will still remain intact haha!   Overall the bag size is just about right to carry around.   **Durability: 9/10**   This Chanel bag is a pebbled cow skin, textured and grainy. This is more likely to be durable. If you're abit clumsy like my sis (no offense) I recommend you getting this type of Chanel classic bag since it's less likely to get scratches. Even though you treat the Chanel bags with extra care, it is still bound to get scratches big or small and retail or not retail.        **Accuracy: 9.5/10**   I'm going to break this down abit so here we go!   ***First glance***, it looks really good. I even joked that what if this was the real one haha but ofc it's not. My sister walked around with these during our tour and she got quite a ton of compliments from it. Hence, its overall look and shape is great!   ***Next, the caviar leather, stitching and diamond shape pattern.***   I've cross-referenced it with the real one and it looks very similar to the retail ones. I even tried to connect the two pictures with the real caviar and they blended so well. The texture of the bag feels really good too. The diamond shape on reps are usually much bigger but this one is just about right. It would be odd for someone to completely stare at the bag trying to measure the sizes of this diamond shape pattern. So there's nothing to worry much about that. In addition, the stitching looks super clean and there aren't any excess cuts or inconsistent stitches on the outside and inside.   ***The side profile of the bag***   The reps side profile is usually wide starting from the bottom to the top. Retail Chanel bags are usually wide at the bottom and it gets skinnier to the top and this bag got it perfectly. (*Thanks Leo :D I've asked him to get this part right)*   ***The CC at the front***   This one is what most people would usually look at when they try to check if your bag is real or not.   Easiest way to call out if they get this wrong:   Right C must overlap on top of the left C and left C overlaps the bottom.   The edges of both C's are not circular which is a good sign. The color is also good and and it would be quite hard to tell if it's real or not if you're seeing someone wearing these while walking. (Just let people wear their bags in peace) The placement of the CC and size is just about right nothing too problematic on this area. :)       **Overall** **Satisfaction: 10/10**   My First impression on these was really good and it stayed that way after the overall checking. My sis used this more than her other bags because it looks really great! Although it is not a mens bag but I really admire how well these are made so well. But if you're a male wanting these bags we don't judge and wear bags that you love! Don't mind others :) As what I've said last time, always wear it with confidence and with great styling! Thanks again Leo!   That's all for my review and I'm still going to have a part 03 soon! Cheers Everyone!;;Looks stunning!!

"Nike,Louis Vuitton,LV","quality,price","Review- LV trainer from Jelly studio Hey guys, hope you all be good during the tough time.   I got my 2 pairs of LV trainers grey/orange from Jelly studio. 43 for myself and 38 for my girlfriend. After the whole purchasing progress and 3 weeks breaks in, here is my brief review of LV trainers of Jelly Studio. Check pics [here](https://imgur.com/a/sZNmgke)  Size: I think I am the few one who brought 38 LV trainer. For me, Nike US 9.5 or Allen Edmonds US 9E goes pretty good to me. I tried LV trainer 42 but it goes little bit narrow. The length is good. Jelly is a very nice seller and he exchanged 43 without a word. So I suggest people who has wide feet like me, try your normal casual shoes size please. For my girlfriend, her feet are very narrow but long. Woman‚Äôs US8.5 runs good to her. After several exchanges, Jelly‚Äôs man 38 LV trainer fits good.  General look. I give 9.6/10 to these shoes. The ‚ÄúLouis Vuitton‚Äù prints are (or maybe) the best in the markets. I tried an authentic one in the local LV retail (not the grey one), Shoes‚Äô sole molding is correct and the leather feels solid. After 3 weeks break in, the end of the shoe tongue is still well constructed. Overall the shoes are very good.  Communication. 10/10. Jelly is nice seller and willing to help you in any issues. Shipment, size, color choice, etc. I cannot recall how many questions I sent to his WeChat. But he still be nice all the way. really worth every recommendation to him.  Price. 700Y. 8/10. I know 100+ dollars for a rep LV is little bit expensive and crazy. But first, the quality Jelly provided is the highest I think, whole leather made, 9/10 details and so many other things, second, if you want a 1:1 (or at least close to 1:1) LV trainer in the market, 700Y is just the medium line.  Conclusion. 9.5/10 recommended. LV trainer seems the specialty of Jelly. If you have the money(700Y) and just like the look of LV trainer, Jelly worth your shot.  https://reddit.com/link/gxj9ta/video/h6i6b0gaj7351/player;;Here's some info for Jelly. zengshuaige.x.yupoo.com, wechat q98634974234.","{upvote:2,timestamp:2020-06-06}",Reddit,0,

"LV,Hermes,Chanel,Versace,YSL","quality,thoughts","Another Long Perfume Guy Fragrance Review (10x Colognes) This is my second review for  Peracar00 (the perfume guy), here is a link to my first: https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/i0y2qo/perfume_guy_fragrance_review_5x_colognes/ (I got locked out of my old Reddit account)  Same Disclaimer As Last Time: I figure I should include the disclaimer that I've only (recently) smelled the retail versions of two of my purchases (Versace: Dylan Blue and Dolce and Gabbana: The One), but I've done a fair bit of research on all of the rest/the notes that they should have and I will be including my thoughts as to how my purchases compare to what I've read. That said, colognes are bound to smell different on everyone because of the uniqueness of our skin compositions, and therefore a non 1:1 rep will still be recognizable based on the notes included as differences can be chalked up to the differences in the way to perfume mixes with our natural musk.  What does this mean? Will they smell exactly the same as retail? Probably not (for the most part at least), but they do smell very, very good, and for that reason I recommend everyone pick up one or two bottles.  > the best advice i can give is to forget the marketing hype / branding and to simply focus on the quality / construction of the underlying oils and the environment you are in. there is no need to buy a tom ford, chanel or whatever (unless money is no object). you can easily get as much satisfaction and compliments out of some of the drug store fragrances (follow the reviews on basenotes, there are some extremely experienced noses there).  -- /u/johnhowardmp  These colognes are outstanding in their own regards, as you read my reviews, please don't take them in the context of how the retail version of the cologne smells (unless of course you really like retail and are looking for the same thing), try to ignore the branding that comes with them and imagine if it's a scent you'd truly enjoy or not, because in all honesty, nobody knows what the hell you're wearing, once you put the cologne on, nobody has any idea who it's from, they just know whether they think it smells good and if you look like you think it smells good. Wear what you enjoy because especially in the cologne world, there's really not point to flexing.  [Pretty Picture](https://i.imgur.com/thpiTQU.jpg)  **Service**  Petar is unmatched, I wouldn't hesitate to buy from him again :)  I bought all of my perfumes in 30mL glass bottles (I've heard that the atomizer on the glass bottles is slightly better), with a 1:3 ratio.  **On To The Fragrance Review**  * Creed - Silver Mountain Water **9/10**  This is definitely one of my top three from this order, it opens with a nice green/black tea note as well as a crisp smelling musk and slightly sweet mandarin orange. I really haven't smelled anything else like this one to be honest, and I really like it. It's nothing super out of the box/polarizing, and for that reason I can see myself getting a lot of use out of it. It's subtle, yet makes a statement; complex, yet simple; and formal, yet casual. Fun fact, Silver Mountain Water was one of David Bowie's signature scents.  * Creed - Green Irish Tweed **8/10**  Green Irish Tweed is very, very unique. It's classy in a very non-traditional sense of the word. This is not something you can wear with a t-shirt and sneakers (it's far too formal), but it's probably not something you'd want to wear to the office. It opens with strong top note of morning dew grass with a sort of lemon zest scent hiding, then dries down to reveal floral (yet still green, think flower leaves) notes with a muted sort of woodiness.  This is the kind of thing I'd wear for a mid/late afternoon get together with family I don't often see, or while hanging out with colleagues off of work (while outdoors) -- it kind of gives me golf course vibes.  * Creed - Virgin Island Water **6.5/10**  At my first spray, I felt like I was on a beach vacation. This is really an escapist cologne, you'd wear it because you want to bring yourself back to that one vacation to coastal Florida/Hawaii. It opens with very strong coconut, lime, and sweet orange notes -- think like a pi√±a colada. It dries down to reveal lime, rum, and beachy floral notes. This is not really something I could imagine wearing regularly (it's so beachy I think I'd find it distracting), and for that reason I think I'll keep it as strictly a vacation scent or might wear it once in a while when I go to the beach, but I'll be looking forward to wearing this one when I can.  * Creed - Royal Oud **8/10**  I'm not even going to lie I thought this one smelled awful when I was smelling it through the bottle, and still didn't think it was my style after I had it on my wrist, but after a couple minutes of dry down, the scent really matured nicely. It started out overly harsh with spices/wood notes that were too strong for me, but then settled down to have slightly sweet berry and floral notes which balanced out the woodiness. It's a luxurious scent, but one that I could see myself wearing somewhat often.  This one has a little bit of undissolved white powdery looking stuff at the bottom, before I spray it I've been shaking it up the remix it in, not sure if I just got a weird batch or if this is how the fragrance is supposed to be, but don't be alarmed if you get this as well.   Note: just resprayed this (a couple days after writing the above paragraph), and the scent didn't have the hard spicy top note it had the first time I sprayed it, no idea why this happened but I think it's pretty cool. I'll probably be wearing this one more than I originally thought.  * Tom Ford - Ombr√© Leather **8.5/10**  Starts off with a strong raspberry note, then dries down to reveal a fresh leather note. Think of like a fresh leather jacket smell. This is very upscale and could go unisex (in fact I'd really like to smell this on a girl). This one would be perfect for a casual, lowkey/relaxed evening. Overall I like this one a lot, and just like the other Tom Ford fragrances, I can see myself starting to like them more and more as I use them for a while. This scent projects very well.  * Tom Ford - Lost Cherry **7.5/10**  Officially, this scent is unisex (as I believe most, if not all of Tom Ford's scents are), but many people think this leans feminine. I bought this for myself because I like how cherry smells are I wanted to see how far I could push the limits, and I'm glad I did. It opens with very strong black cherry and sweet cherry liqueur notes as well as a muted almond note, then dries down to reveal a base of vanilla, wood, and maybe even sweet tobacco (think of the base like the notes revealed on the dry down of Tobacco Vanille) -- of course with the cherries still present.  I imagine my 30mL bottle will last me for quite a long time, since this isn't going to be something I have the opportunity to wear super often, but it will certainly be something fun to wear on evenings out.  * Dolce & Gabbana - The One **7/10**  This one smells pretty much identical to retail IMO. For those of you who don't know what retail smells like, this reminds me of an Axe shower gel/deodorant I used to have, but it gives off a cleaner/more sophisticated vibe. The One opens with sweet grapefruit and basil notes, then dries down to sweet orange and woody notes. It seems more fit for casual use, and generally a younger audience. Since D&G The One is one of the first colognes that got me into the (retail) cologne scene, I'd recommend it to any high schoolers who may be reading this (this works well as a house party scent if you're part of that scene), but I think there are some more mature smelling frags out there that would better fit any of the older audience who may see this.  * Chanel - Platinum √âgo√Øste **9/10**  ""Platinum Chanel cologne and I stay, dressed to impress Spark these bitches interest"" - Nasty Boy -- Biggie Smalls.  I like this one a lot -- it's another in my top three for this order. It opens with floral notes, then dries down to have nice natural wood notes. It's a dynamic scent and gives me a very luxurious vibe. I'll be reserving this bottle for relatively formal events (interviews, big presentations, graduations, etc.) because I feel like it has to be something you're in a particularly confident/serious mood to be wearing and I don't want to ruin it's magic, but I really enjoy this one a lot.  * Paco Rabanne - Black XS **7/10**  I was hesitant buying this one based on a lot of the reviews on Basenotes/Fragrantica (fantastic resources if you're trying to find the vibe of a fragrance before you buy it). A couple notable reviews label the scent as 'over stimulating', 'too synthetic', and IIRC, one even labeled it reminiscent of an MDMA party.   This frag opens with a sweet lemon/pineapple/candy vibe, the combination of which almost smells like strawberry. It dries down to reveal slightly floral and sweet wood notes, but is still almost dominated by the fruity combination for the rest of the life of the spray.  It's definitely a clubbing scent, and I can see it getting lots of attention from girls in that context (which looks to be confirmed by a many of the retail reviews). I'd definitely stick to wearing this one in the evening/night as it's just too sweet for daytime use (for me at least) as heat makes cologne project much more.  * Versace - Dylan Blue **7/10 -- would be higher, but again, I'm kind of bored of blue notes**  Once again, the Perfume Guy's version smells pretty much identical to retail. Like many of the other Versace scents, Dylan Blue smells very clean. It starts off aquatic with slight sour citrus notes (maybe grapefruit/sour pineapple), then dries down to reveal floral notes and hidden mineral notes (think boujee water). It's very versatile and would fair well day or night. I'm personally kind of bored of most 'blue' scents anymore, as for a couple of years recently they were all I had, but I will definitely start wearing this one if/when I get back into them.  **Recap / Conclusion**  Once again, I've very happy with this order. Hopefully I'll be able to pick up some more in a few weeks/months and do another review. I currently have my eye on Bleu de Chanel (Chanel), Play/Pi/Any Other Givenchy Petar can make (Givenchy), Y/La Nuit de l'Homme (YSL), Grey Vetiver (Tom Ford), Terre D'Hermes (Hermes), VIP 212 (Carolina Herrera), and probably a few others -- if you guys have any fragrances you'd like me to review, please let me know! I'll read up on them a bit and if they sound like they'd strike my fancy I'll pull the trigger on buying them!  Once again, I'm very happy with the 1:3 ratio, and I recommend you guys get the same :)  Hopefully I could help you guys decide on what to buy/what not to buy. If you have any questions for me I'd be glad to answer them, but Peracar is very helpful as well if you'd like any specifics!  Edit: WTC /u/Peracar00;;How long was shipping and where are you from.

Nike,"quality,price,comparison","Nike Dunk Low Comparison - EM batch // M batch // L batch I said I'd post a quick comparison of a few different pairs of dunks I copped recently. Today we are looking at :  * EM batch Dunk Low Coast, which sells for ¬•480 and is exclusive to EMsneakers ([link](https://eminem2022.x.yupoo.com/albums/114119827?uid=1)) * M batch Dunk Low Championship Purple - this batch sells for anywhere between ¬•310 and ¬•480 depending on the shoe and these were ¬•380 at the time of purchase (link now dead but search the sub for sellers like Cappuccino) * L batch Dunk Low Coast, ¬•190 from Cappuccino ([link](https://shop1621765644.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4466742144))  EM batch is fairly new to the market and produced in their own factory. M batch for me has been the best price to quality ratio for dunks for a fairly long time, but only for particular pairs (e.g. not SBs). L batch was previously a decent budget option but I wouldn't recommend them now, and you'll see why.  So is the EM batch worth around ¬£12/$14 more than M batch?   Top to bottom - L batch / EM batch / M batch  https://preview.redd.it/l6muwe4gmok91.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8221604e6153057f942883230ce3411002d2483e  First up, the L batch falls at the first hurdle when it comes to the colours of the shoe. The coast colours are not well replicated and the big issue is the lack of sail tint on the white panels and midsole, which the EM batch replicates perfectly. The swooshes have the 'hockey stick' bump on the bottom just before the tick forms which is a hallmark of poor quality batches, and these are miles off the real thing in terms of shape, colour and leather which feels like cardboard.  The EM batch as noted above is great in terms of capturing the look and feel of the real shoe. Having had retail previously the colours are great and this is a real achievement given the subtlety of the sail and coast blue. All key features like the swoosh, panels and painting of the sole look good. The materials are supple and sturdy in key areas, and replicate retail well.  As you would expect, the M batch is the same - the colour looks darker due to the lighting but it is accurate to retail in hand. Again, the M batch looks good in terms of shape and materials - the leather is good and we see the consistency we are used to from the M batch here.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/8r4zhq9nnok91.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d87e836b38ec7a5838469397ab0a2ee4bb9ea25  The flaws of the L batch are again prominent in the top down view.  The toe box is really fat, the heel cup is the wrong shape and the shoe overall is too wide compared to retail, which is a very narrow shoe. The laces and tongue tab are also the wrong share of blue.  The EM batch make a good go of things again - the shape of the shoe is correct and the cuts of leather are even and clean, which is often a flaw with replica dunks. The laces are accurate to retail and so is the tongue tab. If I were to be super critical the lace tab on the tongue is a little bit flimsy and isn't the same material as the tongue itself, but nobody is going to be feeling the materials of your shoes when on foot.  The M batch again looks good - one small critical point is that the tongue is slightly too long and this leads to your foot moving around slightly more when you're breaking the shoe in, but this is barely noticeable. The overall shape of the shoe is good and the laces are accurate.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/8531lphqook91.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c14c9c70528d3c029efc6b439b42ae85d164683  A look a the back of the shoes now, and another F in the chat for the L batch which is closer in height to a dunk mid than a low. This is caused by the leather materials on the upper being too tall - compare the blue back panel with the EM batch - and this has the side effect of everything being stretched. You can see the stitching between the back panel and the Nike tab is covering way too much space, and the nike swooshes are going upwards under the tab rather than a smooth, almost flat progression. The stitching on the NIKE tab is also anaemic.  The EM batch is on top of the M batch, in my opinion, when it comes to the heel. The heel is narrow like retail and you can see the coast heel panel is smoothly cut and fairly short in height, just like retail. The stitching looks good on the NIKE logo, which is thick and raised like it should be. The nike swooshes tuck under the tab smoothly, almost parallel to the three lines of stitching on the sail panel, and this is one part the EM factory got spot on.  The M batch looks pretty good but has a couple of minor flaws that won't ever be called out. The purple back panel is slightly too tall compared to retail and the angle of the swooshes tucking under the Nike backtab is slightly too sharp - however the real calloutable parts of the shoe are good, e.g. the Nike stitching on the backtab and the general quality of the stitching.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ntyp92hxpok91.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21e4b14dd06dd5376214f06281eb5f069ec0d038  Finally, a quick toebox comparison of EM batch and M batch. Pretty much the same here, but you can see the EM batch captures the toebox angle of the front panel, the height of the midsole and the dips in the front panel near the back of the toebox slightly more accurately than M batch. Both shoes have good quality stitching throughout and there's basically nothing to choose between them here.  So who's the winner? Not the L batch is the answer.   But ultimately, you're not going to get called out wearing either of these but from a personal perspective, I found the EM batch got more of the little details right compared with the M batch and it comes back to that question of whether that is worth an extra ¬£12 or $14 to you to make sure you get the most accurate shoe you can and something you're more likely to be satisfied with when it gets to your doorstep.;;I love this post. It needs more attention.  and thank you now I can confidently buy EM batch.","{upvote:2,timestamp:2023-01-18}",Reddit,1,1

Hi guys!  Joined the repfam a few months ago and spent some time lurking and reading through the QCs and tips from everyone here. Wanted to give back a bit and share everything I copped since then! Hope the formatting is ok.  But first, stats!  |*Age*|*Height*|*Weight*|*Tops Size*|*Bottoms Size*|*Shoes*|*Country*| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |29|180 cm (5'11"")|80 kg (176 lbs)|M or L (I like my clothes TTS)|33-34""|US 10-11|Singapore|  I shipped most of my stuff through Taobao Direct or Taobao Consolidated, it's incredibly cheap (perks of being in Asia!) although I can't QC anything. Only used Superbuy for Ultraboost from BM Lin but the shipping is ridiculously expensive: *SG repfam please tell me your tips to buy from BM Lin without Superbuy!*  Ok here we go:  Note: all prices below include local shipping within China  # Tops  **Comme des Gar√ßons Play Tee (L, Black with Gold Heart) --** [**W2C**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.678d2e8dpBhE44&id=550497720198&_u=l2ooipdpf48d) **|** [**Pics**](https://imgur.com/a/dQGJW1N) **|** **¬•138**  This is from the ¬•138 seller. It's pretty close to 1:1 (left eye is slightly more round and the distance between the pupils and the side is a smaller than retail but the shape is great). FYI, few of my friends who own the retail version of this couldn't LC it. Material on the retail piece I own (navy double heart) is softer but this one is quite thick too. Fits me same as retail, it's snug, so if you want an oversized fit, you'll need to size up 1 or 2. Good thing: it didn't shrink after 3 washes. Definite cop. (9/10)  **ASSC Floral Tee (L, Black) --** [**W2C**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.91e52e8dAMzzSq&id=566491932443&_u=l2ooipdp6ff5) **|** [**Pics**](https://imgur.com/a/ERQG00v) **|** **¬•28.90**  The blanket is comfy (Gildan tee). Print looks good to me, though I'm not sure how close it is to retail. Tag is wrong (it's the generic Gildan tag), but for $4 I can't really complain. Fits me TTS (8/10)  **Kith In Bloom Tee (M, Navy) --** [**W2C**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.91e52e8d3ZxawV&id=567594285196&_u=l2ooipdp11d0) **|** [**Pics**](https://imgur.com/a/0CwN5Pc) **|** **¬•99**  Reviewed a bunch of times here already. Really comfy tee-shirt. The print and the tags are both good too, although I think the print is lower than the retail version. Fits me TTS. (9/10)  **Maison Kitsun√© Fox Head Tee (L, Navy) --** [**W2C**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.91e52e8d3ZxawV&id=570450416781&_u=l2ooipdp3045) **|** [**Pics**](https://imgur.com/a/sbm1AXN) **|** **¬•105**  I own a couple of Maison Kitsune retail tees, although none with the fox head patch. The tee is quite soft, but thinner than retail. Fox patch is quite accurate; you really need to look very close to see the differences. The fit is as described, quite close to retail. Only issue: the tag has quite a big hole in it, as if it's deliberately cut (see on the pictures). After contacting the seller, they pointed out that it is specified in the product description (in Chinese), but their pictures show the full tag so it's a bit misleading imo. (7.5/10)  **Gosha Rubchinskiy x FILA Tee (L, Navy) --** [**W2C**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.91e52e8dAMzzSq&id=567505658423&_u=l2ooipdpf3d8) **|** [**Pics**](https://imgur.com/a/kA4VhSE) **|** **¬•29**  A classic here! The print looks very slightly off-center but can't really tell once you wear it. As mentioned by many, the necktag is wrong but doesn't matter, it's a great deal for $4! Fits me TTS. Washed it a few times and it's holding up. Definite cop.

Front print is wrong (too ""clean""; retail print is a bit fuzzy) but I decided to keep it anyways as it's mainly my fault cause I didn't look at the product pictures closely! It was cheap and I can use it for the gym.

Fits well, the blanket is quite comfy, a bit similar to the ¬•138 CDG Play tee. Neckhole is a bit small but otherwise good. Text on the front is good as well. A few loose threads but nothing a simple pair of scissors can't fix. Fits slightly more snug than TTS, upsize if you want oversized.

Not too concerned about UV protection as my contact lenses are already UV protected. Construction is not as solid as retail (some of the screws are a bit loose) but it looks really really close.

[haul overview pic](https://imgur.com/a/c7whmUx)  After months of being locked down, getting scammed for storage extensions, and not being able to ship parcels due to COVID, I finally got around to shipping the second half of my previous 15kg haul. Not sure why paying $40+ for clothes is fine but I get hung up over a dollar fifty so that they don't destroy it in the warehouse. Anyway.  There's a pretty wide variety of stuff this time round, with lots of cool coats and tees, as well as a few accessories. Not as many shoes this time, since I'm running out of ways to convince my family and friends that I need as many shoes as I have.  Quick question for you guys: **do you guys prefer this format or would you rather a slideshow style post next time?** Looks like image haul reviews are the rage at the moment, they do look nice but tend to be harder to click between links/write decent reviews.

Inside logo tag is clean too. Fits very nicely, and feels comfy and warm to wear. There are **lots** of TNF jackets round here in winter, but it's cool to have a different colourway that stands out. It could maybe have been a *bit* thicker but it doesn't bother me too much since it only gets ""cold"" down here in winter, not *cold* cold (looking at you guys, Canada and Northern Europe). The seller's also got a ¬•399 batch which is supposedly thicker so if you need it to be toasty, maybe check that one out ([wego](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fspm%3Da2oq0.12575281.0.0.50111debxhXhFw%26ft%3Dt%26id%3D629939081688&partnercode=w949NG) / [tao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a2oq0.12575281.0.0.50111debxhXhFw&ft=t&id=629939081688)). Since we're heading into summer here down under, this is gonna get a bit of the closet treatment for a while, but looking forward to breaking it out when the temp starts dropping again.  **CAV EMPT Corduroy Jacket AW18 // ¬•234.00 // $33.39 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D578289247631&nTag=Bar-search&from=search-input&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=578289247631) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Jx2M6jt))  Size: M // Colour: Navy   Looks : 7/10 // Feel: 6/10 // Overall: 6.5/10   Weight: 1126g  Thoughts:   The colours on this one are a little strange; retail is meant to be a navy blue. It looks super black and dark in the QC, but in hand it's a bit closer to blue, even verging on green in some lighting? Not too much to worry about because Cav Empt isn't that well known round here anyway. Apart from that, the badge is great, text is good, and jacket itself is alright. The sleeves are a bit wide I feel, but the jacket length and shoulders fit nicely. Not the most comfy jacket I've ever warm, but does the job and feels adequately warm to wear. Not sure if I'd cop again for quite that price but if you like the piece a lot it might suit you.  **Fear of God Clouds Denim Jacket // ¬•201.24 // $30.73 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D605565618917%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.c388bc6&nTag=Bar-search&from=search-input&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=605565618917&spm=1101.1101.N.N.c388bc6) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/wTXyAeb))  Size: M& // Colour: Blue and green pink blooming   Looks : 1/10 // Feel: x/10 // Overall: 1/10  Thoughts:   Fuck this was garbo. Warning: QC pics may be vomit inducing. I gp'd so many different sellers on both tao and weidian looking for this piece, and this was the only one that even ended up shipping. Garbage looking batch: I don't know what clouds these guys were looking at but the colours aren't even remotely close to the original pattern. Incorrect buttons and inner tags too. Returned & refunded as fast as I could really. If anyone's got a good hookup for this piece, lemme know.  **~~Blank Archive~~** **MAMC Gradient Coat** **^(legit)** **// ¬•428.00 // $65.55 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D542782802382&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=542782802382) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/6MHbS92))  Size: S // Colour: spot   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 8/10   Weight: 1344g  Thoughts:   **Fuck Taobao Resellers.** Was originally looking at this coat on Blank Archive as it looks like a cool, semi-formal long coat for winter, but saw a comment saying that the company drop-ships from taobao. Reverse image search and what do you know: there it is. Selling for $65 on TB, $145 on BA. They didn't even bother to shoot new photos and just stole them too. Fuck you guys. Anyway, this is a cool piece, the outside is awesome looking and the inside is lined with a warm, kinda faux-fur material. It's not overly long for this kind of a coat, comes up at above knee height. Again, it's getting hot down under so it's gonna sit in the closet for a couple of seasons but can't wait to break this one out on some chilly winter evenings (or even show off in the office maybe?).  # üß• Hoodies/Crewnecks üß•  **CAV EMPT Night Vector Crewneck // ¬•128.00 // $18.58 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D602614643398&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=602614643398) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/CSpLcx8))  Size: M // Colour: Black   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 6/10 // Overall: 7/10   Weight: 1126g  Thoughts:   Love the graphics on this, especially the minimalist line drawing on the back. It's actually really thick and heavy feeling, and fits a bit oversized which is nice. It's more of a sleeves up to the hands not sleeves up to the wrist type fit. The inside lining is a bit more on the rough side than the soft side, but doesn't make it uncomfortable to wear at all. The front graphic is maybe a little bit too faded and dark, but not noticeably so, and the rubber badge is decent quality. It's also got the reversible inside graphic too which is awesome. There were quite a lot of loose threads when it first arrived, but nothing an appointment with Dr Scissors couldn't fix, and it hasn't fallen apart yet either. A really dope piece for CE fans.  **Acne Studios Flogho Sweatshirt // ¬•269.00 // $40.82 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D610971065962&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=610971065962) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/o4RkS9d))  Size: S (adult) // Colour: Black   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 9/10 // Overall: 9/10   Weight: 554g  Thoughts:   If you don't own a sweater with writing on the collar in late 2020, wyd? Topacney continually manages to knocks things out of the park when it comes to acne studios. This is a pretty simple crewneck, but it looks fire and feels really comfy. Soft, slightly elastic material, neck hole isn't too loose, inner lining is soft and warm. This one just feels great to wear. I really don't have too much more to say, it fits great but check yourself against the size charts or send him a message as his pieces tend to run quite large. He was pretty helpful on wechat regarding sizing.  **Vintage Nike Mini Swoosh Hoodie // ¬•145.00 // $22.01 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D614687794037&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=614687794037) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/a1fWJkA))  Size: L // Colour: Earth Colour   Looks : 7/10 // Feel: 5/10 // Overall: 6/10   Weight: 752g  Thoughts:   Ambition's second batch. I really wanted the tan coloured one, but it was sold out in M. I ended up going for L and hoping it was oversized, but damn this thing fits LARGE. Lengthy and the sleeves have a lot of slack which means unless I hit a mid-20s growth spurt, it's unlikely this is gonna fit me very well at any point. Disappointing because the hoodie itself looks quite nice (although doesn't have drawstrings for the hood) and feels decent. The inner lining isn't the softest and it doesn't feel quite as thick as some of my other hoodies but still passes the vibe check at $20. Will probably get worn round the house or just as a comfort piece but a little disappointed it won't make it out much. Might cop another in a smaller size if it's restocked. Definitely go either TTS or 1 down with this one.  **Palace x Ralph Lauren Skate Polo Bear Sweater // ¬•135.00 // $21.10 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D582982077742%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.3f6f7d4&nTag=Bar-search&from=search-input&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=582982077742&spm=1101.1101.N.N.3f6f7d4) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/TO4SBsl))  Size: M // Colour: Navy Blue   Looks : 5/10 // Feel: 9/10 // Overall: 7.5/10   Weight: 861g  Thoughts:   This one's interesting, because while it's not really the most 1:1 rep you'll ever see, holy *shit* is it comfortable. I don't know exactly how they made it, but it's so soft it feels like touching a cloud. It's amazing if you just want a nice sweater with a cool picture on it, but there are some flaws which need to be pointed out. The knit on the sweater isn't quite as good as retail, it's much thinner and more fine, not coming off so much as a knitted sweater. The colours on the bear aren't quite right either, which is especially noticeable on the face - the contrast is just a bit too high. The P on the jacket isn't quite as crisp either. Lastly, the skateboard kinda dips in the middle (looks like my man's riding a ripstick lmao) but this isn't so much of a probably when wearing since the fabric bends anyway. At least this one DOES have an RL embroidered on it. The inner tags are slightly different too. This may not be good for my UK repfam due to all the flaws, but if you're like me you may just want a reasonably accurate sweater for a significantly cheaper price. I haven't heard of any better batches coming so this might be your best bet. It's a little rough around the edges but nothing in life is perfect so I can learn to love it.  **Kapital Skeleton Knit Sweater // ¬•258.00 // $40.89 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D626798325742&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=626798325742) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/RJdHW1m))  Size: 1 // Colour: army green   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 9/10 // Overall: 9.5/10   Weight: 680g  Thoughts:   Now THIS is how a knit should be. It's wide knit, but very sturdy. The holes are actually a part of the knit, meaning they're sewn in around the outside and don't have loose threads. Looks great, and feels super soft and warm to wear. There's only 2 sizes: size 1 fits me great as a M style fit. This the type of sweater ya granny would give you and you cherish for years. Personally, I think I would have preferred the skeleton graphic to be on the front of the sweater but hey that's a complaint for the designers at Kapital, not the repmaker. So as far as this one goes, great quality and good looks. Didn't quite sneak it in for spooktober but alas.  # üëï Tees/Long Sleeves üëï  **Acne Studios Upside Down Logo Tee // ¬•124.20 // $20.94 USD**  (~~WeGoBuy~~ // ~~W2C~~ dead // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/OFwwxrz))  Size: S // Colour: black   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 9/10   Weight: 359g  Thoughts:   Pretty hard to get wrong, it's a black tee with some white text.

Anyone who's been in this sub for longer than 13 seconds knows about UK and the quality of his guess tees. This one is no excpetion, fits just like any of his other tees, feels comfy enough to wear, and the 3M is reflective under the light. I kinda wish I'd copped some of the other colourways than black to work with some other fits, but it's hard to go wrong with a black and white tee in a fit either. If you're a fan of 3M shit and just straight up going and utterly fucking up people's flash photos, this is a tee for you.  **Comme Des Garcons Play Red Heart Tee // ¬•119.00 // $18.06 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D614657350036&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=614657350036) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/M3BxR4f))  Size: Male L // Colour: Black with Red   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 8/10   Weight: 201g  Thoughts:   Heart looks really decent, good shape and stitching. Rest of the shirt looks black (as expected for a black tshirt). Held it up next to my retail CDG longsleeve, and could barely tell the difference between logos. Material is quite soft and nice too. Seller has a few different colour combos so pick what you like best. But if you buy this it means you like boys, haha get it guys??? Because of the brand name?? It means you like boys??

Pretty much the definition of ""meh"" in a tee. The graphic shape is accurate enough, but it looks like it's been heat-pressed on and seems plastic-y where I'm pretty sure the original is screen printed. It's also missing the palace symbol where the tag is. The blank is damn thin as well. Material is soft, so I'll probably just wear this around the house some. But hey, you get what you pay for I guess. Should I just be happy a shirt even arrived for $9? Maybe.  **Palace P-3D Longsleeve Ultimo 17 // ¬•71.00 // $10.02 USD**  (~~WeGoBuy~~ // ~~W2C~~ dead // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/ildiugq))  Size: M // Colour: Black   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 9/10   Weight: 419g  Thoughts:   Quick side note does anyone else get kinda amazed when they think about the fact they can receive decent quality, thick, accurate clothes for like 10 bucks? For not even one hour's work at minimum wage, this shirt is a definite COP. Looks very accurate as far as I can see, has the correct symbol where the tag should be, and the blank feels heavy & thick. Even came with the palace paper tag on the inside. In my opinion this is one of the coolest trifergs, so definitely super happy with this cop. W2C is dead unfortunately, but reverse image search and you should get some more options.  # üëñ Pants üëñ  **Amiri Distressed Leather Insert Jeans // ¬•249.00 // $37.67 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D621136326611&nTag=Bar-search&from=search-input&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=621136326611) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/bN5iepk))  Size: 30 // Colour: Black   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 9/10   Weight: 633g  Thoughts:   Can we agree we need WAY more quality pants in this sub? These are fantastic. Fits TTS, skinny fit but slightly elastic, really comfy overall to wear. Construction feels good. Love the leather patches, it's great for both the aesthetic of distressed jeans, and the fact nobody gotta see my hairy-ass knees. My ONLY gripe is that the pockets are just a little too shallow. Fits a phone (barely) and that's about it. These'd be in the rotation way more often with just slightly deeper pockets.  **Nike Techwear Pants // ¬•94.00 // $14.98 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy/selfservice/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fweidian.com%2Fitem.html%3FitemID%3D3107923938&from=search-input&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3107923938) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/9FKZb1n))  Size: M // Colour: black   Looks : 5/10 // Feel: 5/10 // Overall: 5/10   Weight: 510g  Thoughts:   These are most likely a fantasy piece, I thought they might be a cool and different style to most of my other stuff, but unfortunately in person they're not as great. They don't feel super uncomfortable for techwear pants, but the swoosh on the right pocket is large as all hell and the text on the left side patch is utter nonsense. They're pretty wide around the calves, but short and tight at the ankles making the fit a bit awkward. As pants, they work but that's about the best it gets really.  **Burberry Style Plaid Pants // ¬•100.00 // $15.63 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D568047226509%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.56fa495&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=568047226509&spm=1101.1101.N.N.56fa495) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/K9pXxyw))  Size: M // Colour: deep khaki   Looks : 4/10 // Feel: 3/10 // Overall: 3/10   Weight: 195g  Thoughts:   Can't help but feel kinda scammed with these. I wasn't looking for EXACTLY burberry pants, just something in that style, but these aren't wearable. They're SUPER lightweight and thin, and feel almost more like summer pyjama pants than real pants (which is probably what they'll end up being). They're also pretty dark, closer to brown in hand. I don't think I could even wear these out, and considering the price of some of the other stuff in this review? Save your $15. Take it elsewhere.  **Generic Loose Heel Pants // ¬•60.00 // $9.07 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D524278820464&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=524278820464) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/1nVMkVk))  Size: L // Colour: Black thin section smooth   Looks : 7/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 7/10   Weight: 483g  Thoughts:   Was just looking for some general pants in this style with the loose heel cut. These are pretty decent; they're kinda silky, almost like formalwear pants. The heel is maybe not quite as boxy as I'd like, but they feel really comfy and are still tight around the waste. Pretty much the exact perfect length for me too so no real complaints here. Just some decent pants too vary up my fits.  # üß¶ Socks/Underwear üß¶  **Tommy Hilfiger Underwear // ¬•19.00 // $2.89 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D590187367243&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=590187367243&spm=1101.1101.N.N.640d55b) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/HV4qQER))  Size: L // Colour: sapphire   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 7/10 // Overall: 7/10   Weight: 124g (2 pairs)  Thoughts:   Pretty decent for the price. Colour is nice, text is good. But who're you pretending is gonna see these anyway? They're maybe a little on the small side, the thigh sections occasionally ride up a little. But keeps shit in place and makes you seem more like you're packin tho by comparison so toss up the pros and cons I guess?  **Nike Lab Tiedye Socks // ¬•19.00 // $2.97 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D617948459065&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=617948459065) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/M3RYH0i))  Size: OS // Colour: 1x blue purple, 1x pink blue and white, 1x green, white and blue   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 7/10 // Overall: 8.5/10   Weight: 90g ea  Thoughts:   These are a STEAL for the price. Love the look of these, the pink and blue ones gotta be my favourite colorway, so summery. They feel pretty nice to wear too, not the *most* elastic sock ever but definitely comfy. Great way to splash and extra little bit of color into a fit. Definitely a good cop for 3 bucks. More socks = doing the washing less often. Trust me the math checks out.  **Palace P Socks AW17 // ¬•10.00 // $1.52 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D545144455504&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=545144455504) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Q4nmSLV))  Size: n/a // Colour: 1x White, 1x Black Red Bar   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 8/10   Weight: 60g ea  Thoughts:   I think it was Confucius who once said ""one's haul can never have too many socks"". It's a dollar fiddy for some Palace socks. Are you even gonna read if I write anything else? They're made of a nice stretchy material and don't feel stiff or scratchy to wear like some other socks I've had.  # üëü Shoes üëü  **Common Projects Suede Chelsea Boot // ¬•398.00 // $62.19 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D564097158828&nTag=Bar-search&from=search-input&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=564097158828) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/pkKiKU8))  Size: 44 (male models) // Colour: Sand Chelsea   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 10/10 // Overall: 9/10Weight: 1673g  Thoughts:   Shoutouts saiyou0018 who took FIVE qc pics for free. It'd be nice to get a few more shoes in the sub that aren't Jordans or other sneakers. But these are GOOD. Like, real *good* good. Fits like a glove (a foot glove?) and are actually really comfy to wear?! I was expecting it to be blister town: population me with these, but they slip on as easily as 8 year olds on Xbox live slip into my mother apparently. The insoles feel really cushiony too. Would definitely recommend some kind of waterproofing or other protection though as the rubber soles and suede outside can get dirty pretty easily. A little more on the expensive side for shoes in this sub, but for those who want something a little classier these are worth every penny.  **Yeezy Boost 350 Static Black Reflective // ¬•149.00 // $23.96 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy/selfservice/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fweidian.com%2Fitem.html%3FitemID%3D3006913723&from=search-input&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3006913723) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/QzuzmOD))  Size: 44 // Colour: Black Starry   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 6/10 // Overall: 7/10   Weight: 1229g  Thoughts:   *Right after I say we need more non-sneaker shoes...* r/fashionreps and cheap weidian shoes, name a better combo. For a $24 weidian sneaker, I was honestly not expecting this level of quality. They're properly reflective under light, the shape is good and the laces aren't *too* stiff. They're maybe a tad on the tighter size, so I'd recommend sizing up .5 or 1 size for the most comfy fit. Whenever my fam comes over they ask me how many sneakers I could possibly need and I'm willing to take suggestions on how to answer that question.  # üíé Accessories/Other üíé  **Palace P 6 Panel Corduroy Cap // ¬•32.00 // $4.86 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D606492315521&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=606492315521) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/KOjxFMh))  Size: adjustable // Colour: red   Looks : 7/10 // Feel: 7/10 // Overall: 7/10   Weight: 103g  Thoughts:   More corduroy for my retro stylers. Feels a bit thinner and flimsier than some of my other caps, but looks good and stays on my head. I was a little worried about the stitching of ""PALACE"" at the back, but looks fine in person. Has palace tags on the inside too, so for $4.86 (holy shit I just remembered this was $4.86) this one delivers.   **Fear of God 6th Collection Suede Hat // ¬•78.00 // $11.84 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D615857486274&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=615857486274) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/O5kmAtZ))  Size: 165/80a // Colour: Gray   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 7/10   Weight: 130g  Thoughts:   The novelty of this one wore off a bit when I started struggling to work this into as many fits as I'd like, which is disappointing since the quality is really good. But hey, you might be better than me on that front. The suede feels and looks nice, the rubber FOG tag is perfect as far as I can see, and has the correct inner tag too. Fits nicely on my big ass head, and has velcro adjustment. Maybe figure out how you wanna wear this one, but for $12 it's a solid cop.  **Stussy Stock Low Pro Cap // ¬•28.00 // $4.24 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D560907281720&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=560907281720) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/4igEJK1))  Size: adjustable // Colour: Light Khaki   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 9/10 // Overall: 9/10   Weight: 94g  Thoughts:   How many caps is too many caps? This haul plus my last couple of hauls has the stack of caps in my wardrobe lookin like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. I apparently thought this cap was so good I bought 2 by mistake. Fortunately my agent had me and returned 1. But yeah, it's good. Fits on my head and keeps the sun out of my eyes. Nice stitching on the front. Love the cream colour.

Trust me you'll be lacking if you don't. This one's good, decent length and not tight around the neck. There's 3 different connecting sections where you can join it up, so you can adjust the length based on how close to your neck you want it. It's even got engraving on the little linking sections too. The fabric bag it comes in is kinda poor quality, but if you're the kind of person who cares about that, you might wanna be spending a little more than 14 bucks on this type of thing. Can't believe it came with the upside down flaw tho smh!!! ^(/s)  **Goyard Saint Marc Card Case // ¬•76.00 // $11.54 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D543066571588&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=543066571588) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Ml0gQ4I))  Size: n/a // Colour: Dark brown   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 7/10 // Overall: 7/10   Weight: 175g  Thoughts:   There comes a time in every young repfam's life where they evolve from a Goyard cardholder to a full Goyard wallet. Outside looks nice, embossed text on the inside is pretty good too. It's quite large (better have big pockets): there's 5 card slots and then some pockets for cash, receipts, drugs, condoms, whatever else you want I guess. Kinda wish it held a few more cards but for $10? Not gonna complain too much I don't think. Various colorways available, but you can't knock the classic brown IMO.  **Palace P Bottle Opener // ¬•149.00 // $22.61 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D602594211180&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=602594211180) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/izphJHj))  Size: n/a // Colour: Rose Red   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 8/10   Weight: 21g  Thoughts:   This could be retail considering the price? Who cares, I thought it was cool and needed a bottle opener. Before I got this I spilt beer all over my floor at home trying to open a bottle using another bottle. Which while it technically worked, isn't really optimal. This thing looks fine, and opens bottles. There's a blue version too if that's more you. That's about it really.  **Maison Kitsune Fox Head Tote Bag // ¬•65.00 // $9.84 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D604814997325&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=604814997325) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/LWPVfHm))  Size: n/a // Colour: spot   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 8/10   Weight: 227g  Thoughts:   This is a bag. It holds things in it. It also has a picture and some text on the front. In all seriousness, there's really not a lot I can say, $10 is maybe overpaying for it a little bit, but looks nice and is great for carrying stuff around at Uni or work. Feels sturdy enough, and is made of a canvas-like material.  \*\*\*  # FINAL THOUGHTS  Pretty happy with most things in this haul, I generally lucked out this time around with things fitting correctly and being decent quality (with the few obvious exceptions). My wardrobe's starting to feel pretty full now, so I'm not sure what will come in my next haul but I'm sure there'll be some things I can't resist copping. Someone better remind me to add in some extra coathangers.  Let me know if you guys want any in-hand pictures or fit pics. Happy to answer any DMs if you need extra info. I was also thinking of putting together some styleboards using lots of my reps so far so drop a comment if that sounds interesting.

,"fast fashion,sustainable,quality,price","Fast fashion    Hi, guys! At this point, I think we all know about the dark side of fast fashion and the impact it has on climate change, but if you bought clothes from fast fashion brands all you‚Äôre life it can be pretty hard sometimes to switch to the sustainable side. Here are some tips and tricks for when you go thrifting or to make your fast-fashion clothes last longer and be more sustainable!   Thrift-shops tips:  1. Be patient - In most second hands it‚Äôs not gonna be easy to find exactly what you want at your first look. This type of store sometimes requires good eye-sight and some time dedication. 2. Don‚Äôt only brand shop - Second hands are some of the best stores to find vintage design pieces at an affordable price, and while this is really nice, we should avoid buying clothes that don‚Äôt fit us well, or are too far from our usual style just because they are designer items. Otherwise, we might end up not wearing them as much as we thought. 3. Buy smart! - It‚Äôs easy to overbuy when you go shopping and end up getting items that you will probably end up wearing once. Try to scan your wardrobe and see what you‚Äôre missing from it, and try to set a budget, that way you will be more careful and only buy the stuff you need.   Fast fashion tips: 4. Look for quality pieces - it‚Äôs hard to completely avoid fast fashion stores, but you can still try to make your experience more sustainable. You can look for clothing items that are made out of higher quality material this way they will last longer. 5. Avoid trend buying - clothes go in and out of fashion, and it‚Äôs easy to sense which clothes are here just for a season or simple clothes that will always look good, like jeans, white shirts, coats, and so on. 6. Wash them properly - clothes can last a lot longer if you wash them as the tag says, and if you take care of them in general.  [u/Rishloos](https://www.reddit.com/u/Rishloos/) have you tried any of these tips?;;and when I try to tell people to buy quality instead of quantity, they dislike my post. This reddit is filled with way too much budget stuff. always steals (i call it trash).  When I click through some Hauls, there s sometimes the same shirt in 4 different colors, how often you re going to wear this?","{upvote:11,timestamp:2021-11-03}",Reddit,1,0

I've been trying to find them online and the closest I got to actually buying them was a bidding on Alibaba. These shoes don't even seem to exist on the Playboy footwear website ([https://playboy-footwear.com](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjbwp-HxoHyAhW9QzABHW_PDG8QFjAAegQIBhAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fplayboy-footwear.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw1d0l1sy5dkrFD1r_sUQtJI)). I've checked Foot Locker, Amazon Ebay, Lazada, Shopee, Ali Express...pretty much everywhere and then I decided ""Y'know what? Imma just buy a pair of shoes and mod them myself"" so I'm looking for a brand that I can customize that looks similar to this at least (New Balance, Nike and Reebok are contenders but not quite what I'm looking for).  TL;DR: Looking for the shoes in the picture. Any info about them is appreciated (including where to get them). If not, I'm also looking for shoes with a similar design/ aesthetic so that I can customize them myself.","{upvote:1,upvoteRatio:1.0,timestamp:2021-07-27}",Reddit,0,

Today I have a few  announcements and an interest check so lets begin:     **FedEx Meeting**     I had a meeting with FedEx and I got following shipping prices up to 0,5kg.     USA: 2400dinars (20,3euros). I will be charging 17,5euros for it     Europe: 2050-2400 dinars (17,3-20,3euros). I will be charging 15-17,5euros     Other countries were too expensive but they told me they are going to lower the prices if I get shipments going. Estimated arrival is 1-4workings days since shipped.     Compared to Serbian Post which charges up to 1kg:     Europe: 1290dinars(10,9euros). I am charging 10euros     USA: 2090dinars (17,7euros). I am charging 15euros     Serbian post estimated delivery is from 6-12working days although I had some packages that arrived late or got lost (had to reship the order from my own pocket since the refund system in post is a joke). Declaring  lower amount of package worth is harder than FedEx since I am doing it legaly in program so I have to write as I get amount on paypal (but if customer tells me to write lower amount before sending invoice we can always work it out). FedEx lets me declare it as I want and lets me mark it as a gift so there is no custom issue.     **Now for interest check part:**   I am restocking perfumes soon and I am looking to get new ones. Please let me know in comments which one would you like to purchase. For now I have in my mind: Tom Ford- Tuscan Leather, Prada- L'homme and Saint Laurent la nuit de l'homme. Looking forward to those comments.     All orders for last few days were shipped. Here is a pic of the packages on the way to the post office  [https://imgur.com/a/QeIFxLL](https://imgur.com/a/QeIFxLL?fbclid=IwAR1uXNSgF6cl05egoTnigvC_x1BS-TA1U1ZWu2odEL2I8poYE6Us4lmf6Qw)      Now I have a request for moderators. Would they also allow me to get paid via friends and family? It would save me money since paypal cuts me off 1,5euros-4euros per transaction. I would let customers to choose paypal invoice  the way of payment if they dont feel comfortamble enough to pay with friends and family.     Again I would love to thank all of you for trusting me.

Forgot to take Fitpics before I went on holiday so got my gf to take some mirror selfies. Looks good on men or women.  *Fun fact* : Since the hoodie material is thick and heavy, *Champion* implemented reverse weave stitching to prevent 'drooping' and thus increasing aesthetic appeal and structural stability.    **[W2C](https://m.intl.taobao.com/detail/detail.html?id=562633828776)** | **[Photos + Fitpics](http://imgur.com/a/8xjNcqG)** &nbsp;  ####**Champion x Undefeated Tee [Konng Gonng]**   | ***162¬•*** | ***380g***    Cool design for a good price.

This list has been years in the making, and I've kept it curated and updated the entire time I've been involved in reps.  Below are 250+ Weidian stores, with return ratings and notes for most of them.  (If you're on mobile, scroll to the right to see all of the info for each store.)  Every store has at least a double-digit return rate (return rate is the percentage of customers who make multiple purchases from a store - higher = better).  The list is organized alphabetically by store name.  In my notes, budget = <200y, midrange = 200-400y, high-end = >400y.  **STORE NAME** | **LINK** | **RETURN RATE** | **NOTES**  --- | --- | --- | --- 33

Shit, it‚Äôs been months since I‚Äôve even done a haul. I‚Äôve mainly been looking for some rarer pieces and items that are looking like they‚Äôre low on stock with little hope of restocking. On top of that, I‚Äôve been somewhat separating my future hauls by brands, with this one obviously being Rhude lol.  Rhude‚Äôs been growing as my favorite brand for the past couple of years and I‚Äôm super excited to see a lot of their stuff being repped lately. My next few hauls will mostly consist of Off White, Chrome Hearts, Kapital, with some other rarer pieces or items going out of stock.¬†  10.8 KG Haul shipped GD E-EMS.

From u/FashionAngelKing ([angelking47.x.yupoo.com](http://angelking47.x.yupoo.com/)) he has definitely become my go-to for these. The White with Yellow Print version has been my favorite tee for close to a year now and I‚Äôve been sleeping on getting the others. The main reason I went with Angel for these is because I‚Äôve actually gotten to see the production process for these which makes me trust him for them rather than middle man sellers.¬†   >   >¬†The only retail version of the Moonlit Tee I‚Äôve held in hand was the Black with Blue Print and I would definitely say it is softer, to be fair it‚Äôs from a completely different season / year so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Rhuigi changed the material. I‚Äôve ordered that one from Angel as well so I will definitely review that once I have it in hand. For these, the material is definitely thicker and what I‚Äôd describe as ‚Äúrougher‚Äù if that makes any sense. So I can‚Äôt really say how close the material and feel is to retail of these, but I can definitely say they are quality tees. Nice material and a somewhat ‚Äúheavy‚Äù feel to them.¬†   >   >Ngl, the accuracy is honestly perfect. Retail batches had different distressing on the logos so it 100% passes as retail for looks. Only r/FashionReps users would be able to call you out that it‚Äôs a rep because all of the tees in this batch have the same distressing, really not a big deal. You can see the signature Rhude stitching on the back of the neck which is great as well. I‚Äôm hoping that the logos will fade over time similar to the White / Yellow version I‚Äôve had for awhile now. At first it was mainly solid black but now it has a black acid-wash look to it.   >   >Super unlucky but I accidentally had my dryer set to high when I usually put it on extra low and delicate for all my clothes. So my darker clothes definitely shrunk a bit, you can see the black shirt is shorter than the white, which I air dried. Sucks to suck I guess, if you‚Äôre going to use a dryer, size up.  &#x200B;  # Rhude Silver Eagle Tee (250 g)  In-hand Pics:¬†[https://imgur.com/a/phB07Or](https://imgur.com/a/phB07Or)  W2C:¬†[Spot 37 RHUDE Chicago Limited Eagle Moon Washing Distressed Short Sleeve Retro T](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=618147281651)  >Size Small. From 37 tide, sadly they only had small in stock when I purchased and as I said with the last shirt, I shrunk tf out of it. Also pics are a little deceiving, I‚Äôve never seen retail but the print seems darker than the pics I took and from sellers pics. To be fair, retail looks exactly the same as the pictures on grailed so Idk.¬†   >   >The print and distressing are pretty damn accurate from what I can tell. It has the signature Rhude stitching on the back of the neck which is always good. Materials are nice and has the heavy feel to it as well.   >   >Overall happy with the purchase, no complaints, but if you‚Äôre going to dry with heat size up if you find another seller with it.  &#x200B;  # Rhude Swarovski Wolf Tee (196 g)  In-hand Pics:¬†[https://imgur.com/a/TE5Qzvq](https://imgur.com/a/TE5Qzvq)  W2C:¬†[Marxism independent exclusive Rhude high street wolf head diamond long short sleeve oversize T-shirt](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=573451684417)  >Size small. From Marxism, for those who don‚Äôt know, he‚Äôs one of the most trusted sellers over at r/QualityReps. He‚Äôs known for his attention to detail (most of the time; RIP Riot Bomber) and has his own production processes. I have looked all over Weidian, Taobao, DHGate, etc. and have never seen this elsewhere so he‚Äôs really the only option and this only had size small left when I purchased as well.   >   >This is a super rare piece even for retail so I‚Äôve definitely have never seen this in person. If you look at his side by side pics it‚Äôs practically 1:1 to the retail he has / had in hand. This is from a very early season from about 2-3 years ago and is definitely a different, thinner material compared to all of the other Rhude tees I‚Äôve seen.

"LV,Gucci,Adidas,ASOS","worth it,aesthetic","[DISCUSSION] What to wear for clubbing Hey guys, I recently wrote a small article on what I personally like wearing to a club. It is less a strict recommendation and more some personal experiences since I go out quite frequently. This is mostly in favor for techno clubs and comes from the idea that especially in my hometown Berlin people often get denied access to a club.  I think it fits nicely in this sub and if you like it I would love to hear your opinion on the topic. Maybe continue the list in the comments ;)  &#x200B;  First  of all, let‚Äôs weaken my introduction to this article. It‚Äôs not my right  and not my job to tell you or someone else what cloth to wear and what  to leave at home. The most important part in this article is the  message:  **Wear what you feel comfortable in!**  This most likely will go hand in hand with a wardrobe that represents  your personality. If you aren‚Äôt into bdsm why should you wear a harness  or latex? And if you like your basic grey sweater why is that a ‚Äúbad‚Äù  piece for a night out. Unfortunately some clubs especially in Berlin  have a very strict and sometimes strange door policy. In general I think  that is a good thing, but often people associate that with a certain  way they **need** to dress. A question:  *If someone you are dating wouldn‚Äôt accept you the way you are and wanted you to change, would you?*  Probably not, so why change for a meaningless place. Why change styles  and wear clothing you don‚Äôt feel comfortable in. It doesn‚Äôt matter how  cool you look in the eyes of others and or how spaced out it is. If you  are uncomfortable and insecure about it, it is not worth it! Sure, go  ahead, experiment, try out new fits, brands and styles but don‚Äôt try to  represent someone you are not. But now let‚Äôs start with some pieces:  ## 1. Earplugs:  Got  you! An item you probably didn‚Äôt expect. But clubs and festivals are  loud, think about your health. Your future self will thank you when you  don‚Äôt suffer from tinnitus in your early 30s. Also some bonuses are it‚Äôs  easier to stay longer at a party since your hearing won‚Äôt be exhausted  that quick and it is easier to understand people. At least I feel that  way when I am on the dance floor and someone is screaming in my ear.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are using cheap or special made ones. Just make  sure they fit. Most of the time people don‚Äôt even notice them, so only  advantages in utilizing them.  ## 2. No overly expensive items  Defining  what‚Äôs expensive is difficult. Everybody has a different financial  standpoint. But constantly worrying that someone will step on your  expensive sneakers or burn a hole in your jacket (you spend your whole  savings on) is a clear indicator that those pieces are to valuable for a  night out. Same things apply to unique or statement pieces you love.  Going to a party comes with the risk to leave marks, holes and nasty  smells in your clothing. Only dress in pieces you are ok with wrecking  or potentially loosing. Dress in what you can afford.  ## 3. Avoid big¬†Branding  What  people with expensive clothing also (!caution generalization!) often do  is flexing by showing of big brands. From Gucci Logos to Off-white  Stripes. Why? Nobody cares you spend $600+ on a T-shirt. Most will  probably think you‚Äôre a spoiled person‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsection 2‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwho doesn‚Äôt value  money or his wardrobe.  But this Section isn‚Äôt only valid for expensive brands. In general a  plain T-shirt, jacket or hoodie looks cleaner and way nicer than the  logo of a fashion brand. There are clubs out there that turn down money  from breweries or tobacco companies because they don‚Äôt want to advertise  in their safe space. Help them and don‚Äôt wear advertisement on  yourself.  ## 4. No white¬†shoes  This  one is a personal one and I am sure some people will disagree with me. I  like my shoes clean and take good care of them. In my opinion they  should last a while and it always is a good first impression wearing  clean stuff (including your shoes). Wearing white shoes to a club or  festival is quite counterintuitive. They will get dirty, you can‚Äôt  prevent it! People will step on them and you will never get them truly  clean again.  I  recommend you some dark colored, comfortable sneakers. You will be  dancing alot and you don‚Äôt want to worry about comfort and aesthetics.  With black, grey or dark green no one will see any stains after you‚Äôre  done cleaning them and you will be able to wear them after the party.  Although I can only advice having a beater pair: some old kicks you  don‚Äôt wear that much anymore.  An  additional experience: I love thick shoes (e.g. Fila Disruptor,  Balenciaga Tripple S) but wearing them while dancing is just annoying  and a very unpleasant experience. Keep the weight of your shoes in mind.  ## 5. Flare aka Accessories  Now  that we‚Äôve talked about which items to leave at home, let‚Äôs look into  some stuff that can make your outfit truly unique. I personally love to  see some interesting jewelry on someone. As stated before I am into  basic clothing with maybe some interesting fit‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut no loud prints. So  adding some chains and rings can really elevate the appearance of your  style. Sure it needs to be done tastefully and not like all fake  diamonds with a lot of bling bling.  The  fashion YouTube sangiev is a great example. His use of rings and chains  is pretty bold but definitely an eye catcher. Maybe start with one or  two items check if you feel comfortable and if you do so continue from  there. Same goes for women. Even if you already wear rings try to mix it  up a bit and maybe experiment with some bigger stuff like skull shapes.  Additionally  rings and chains are pretty cheap if you don‚Äôt go with precious metal.  Try finding some shapes you like on eBay and Asos and for well under 50  bucks you‚Äôll be able to add some flare to your outfit.  By the way, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you prefer silver or gold. Look what is most appealing to you.  ## 6. Shoulder¬†bags  Some  love it and some hate it. I get it. This can be super hipster and there  are people, that just don‚Äôt dig the aesthetic. But if you are  constantly worried about stuff falling out of your pocket during a  moshpit, think about a shoulder bag. Fanny packs are also great and  usually smaller so they don‚Äôt influence your outfit too much. Especially  not in a neutral color like black or dark green.  Women who usually don‚Äôt have pockets will love those small bags. But if  you are just not feeling the aesthetics try this alternatively: Adidas  Track pants with zip pockets. You won‚Äôt lose a thing.  &#x200B;  Btw. you can find the original article (with pictures) here on medium: [https://link.medium.com/NyP5lRMaVU](https://link.medium.com/NyP5lRMaVU)","{upvote:3,upvoteRatio:0.64,timestamp:2019-03-13}",Reddit,0,

Gucci,quality,"There is nothing wrong with buying what you enjoy, including big logos. Recently I‚Äôve noticed a trend on this sub that people love to hate on logos and those who buy such pieces.   The fact is, Fashion is supposed to make you feel confident and good about yourself, if that means wearing big Gucci logos and Supreme bogos, so be it.   We are supposed to be a united community. Constantly hating on the choices people make isn‚Äôt helping anyone.   Furthermore, while wearing minimalist clothing and subtle flex is nice, I‚Äôd rather just get those items from a retail store where it will be far less expensive and better quality.   Let‚Äôs stop the hate and respect each other‚Äôs choices.  Much love. Peace.  Edit 1: This blew up! Just to clarify, if you enjoy subtle flexes, get subtle flexes and if you want logos, get logos. Get whatever makes you feel good.;;All of these posts are just posturing to make yourselves feel less insecure.

Adidas,,"Yeezy 350 V1 Turtle Doves Godkiller from Kickwho # Yeezy 350 V1 Turtle Doves Godkiller from Kickwho  [Pics!](https://imgur.com/a/fTyVfvF)  After a long wait, Kickwho has finally began selling their new 350 v1 turtle doves.  These shoes have come a long way since the original first reps, and that whole rep era, which I think some of you might remember. The good old days with the arch support suede material being completely different than retail, and the Adidas logo being tilted are now gone.  The zebra pattern is exactly like retail, it is honestly very difficult to see any difference between this rep and the retail. The colors are matching very well, not overly white. It also features the ""hidden numbers"" that many check for when inspecting this shoe. Boost looks pretty good as well, looks like the 2015 boost that one would expect. Pull tab size is also very nice, usually on many rep yeezy's, especially older batches of this model has huge pull tags, which was pretty much an instant callout. Shape of the shoe is also very nice! The curve of the sock liner has also been a big place for flaws, but this shoe looks pretty nice. Color and shape of sole is well made - retail soles are very white, and so are these. They also curve nicely.  All that being said, turtle doves are one of those pairs where some people are so trained in checking if they are fake, that even these crazy close-to-retail reps would probrably not fool everyone. Another thing to note is that a retail deadstock, non yellowed pair of turtle doves in 2022 is probrably pretty rare, meaning the largest callout on these is how fresh they look.  In conclusion, these are definitely a shoe worth picking up if you are still sad over the old batches of turtle doves not being that good. They will also definitely satisly that good old ""i feel like pablo"" nostalgia that some of us still walk around with :)    ## W2C:  [kickwho.xyz](https://kickwho.xyz/adidas-yeezy-boost-350-turtle-dove2022-godkiller-p-5154.html);;I wish they would make the other colors as well :( I def need to pick these up","{upvote:1,timestamp:2022-06-03}",Reddit,1,1
"Gucci,Dior","fast fashion,quality,price","Reps are soo much better than genuine A genuine question for all out there who have copped reps and the real deal. But do you think reps are of a better higher quality than the genuine items?  For context, I worked at footlocker during my uni days and now that I have a professional job I still until recently copped the genuine items. BUT Jordan brand for examples quality is soo trash I‚Äôm surprised majority of their shoes hit the retailers and pass QC.  AND I‚Äôve bought genuine designers items in the past like Saint Laurent Paris, Gucci (trash quality why do people go crazy for this stuff??) and Dior. And if I‚Äôm being honest the quality of these designer items is soo trash for the price you pay. I‚Äôve had fast fashion items last and age better. I used to buy alot of SLP jeans but my Carhartt jeans and Levi jeans have aged soooo much better as better quality!

LV,"quality,price,haul","UFOBUY is scamming me and the mods wouldn't help! (Part 2) **I kindly request all of you to upvote for visibility.**  Dear all, hope you‚Äôre doing well today. As you may have read, I had an issue with Ufobuy a few months ago, you can find that post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/repbudgetsneakers/comments/v5elhn/ufobuy_is_scamming_me_and_the_mods_wouldnt_help/), it‚Äôs important to read that post in order to go ahead.  As I mentioned in the update of the previous post, I tried to reach an agreement with Ufobuy where both of us actually benefit instead of them simply sending my stuff to another agent for free, by giving me a discount on the shipping, and they agreed, and guess what? I was stupid to trust them.  So I had plans of reviewing the biggest haul in the history of the sub, 60kgs where I planned to divide them into 7 separate packages to avoid customs clearance as each shall not exceed 10kgs at most.  Agreed with them on WeChat and paid for everything on the 22nd of August 2022, tracking showed up a few days after and I picked all the packages up from the post office on 13th Sep 2022, and had to pay about 5 USD to receive each as doorstep delivery as it was not included, not a big deal but worth mentioning.  When I opened my packages, I was shocked to see that so many items are missing. Out of 60.75kgs that I paid for, I only received 45.90kgs, Ufobuy manipulated all package sizes and increased them all.  The list of missing items is here: [https://imgur.com/a/4Xv7Cgi](https://imgur.com/a/4Xv7Cgi)  The issue now is that the unboxing videos are large in size, even after reducing their quality, so I‚Äôll just share the links from my google library.  \- Package 1: paid for 8.8kgs but received 6.9kgs (1 t-shirt missing).  Ufobuy order number: FO22081821353473491, Tracking number: CY010291872CN, Unboxing video sent to mods.  \- Package 2: paid for 8.1kgs but received 6kgs (3 foam runners missing).  Ufobuy order number: FO22081821353473491, Tracking number: CY010291872CN, Unboxing video is unfortunately not available.  \- Package 3: paid for 8.9kgs but received 7.8kgs (nothing missing, straightaway scamming at this point).  Ufobuy order number: FO22081822013338097, Tracking number: CY010293357CN, Unboxing video sent to mods.  \- Package 4: paid for 8.4kgs but received 7kgs ( 1 t-shirt missing).  Ufobuy order number: FO22081822130895699, Tracking number: CY010294595CN, Unboxing video sent to mods.  \- Package 5: paid for 8.7kgs but received 7.7kgs (1 short & 1 bracelet missing).  Ufobuy order number: FO22082213505071676, Tracking number: CY010296659CN, Unboxing video sent to mods.  \- Package 6: paid for 8.9kgs but received 4.6kgs (2 sneakers, 2 shorts, 1 slide & 1 t-shirt missing).  Ufobuy order number: FO22081821241279190, Tracking number: CY010296092CN, Unboxing video sent to mods.  \- Package 7: paid for 8.8kgs but received 5.9kgs (5 t-shirts & 1 sneaker missing).  Ufobuy order number: FO22081821582093593, Tracking number: CY010294865CN, Unboxing video sent to mods.  I then noticed that none of the items that were from my previous post actually showed up, not even a single item, they lost my items and decided not to inform me, instead totally faking the entire thing up. I have unboxing videos for most packages as proof and the weight is actually printed on them by the shipping company. I can provide my account login info for the admins to investigate my case and verify the fact I‚Äôve stated in my videos.  After a lot of negotiation again and again, and after a lot of rejection from their side, they offered to compensate me with 200¬• and then upgraded their offer to 500¬•, and they finally offered 500¬• shipping coupon every month for five months (Total of 2500¬•) when I threatened to expose them & use PayPal chargeback.  I don't even want to use Ufobuy, I just want my money back, I'm not even able to withdraw my account balance, it's an absolute mess.  I calculated the prices of the items, their QC & domestic shipping, it came up to around 1130¬•, and for shipping, I divided the total price that I paid on 60.75kgs then multiplied that ¬•/kg rate into the total weight of packages I received and my total loss is around 2500¬• - 3000¬• considering that I may have shipped fewer packages, decreasing the rate of ¬•/kg if I had been informed before shipping.  The above has been sent to mods 15 days ago and as usual, nobody is replying! u/RepSanta  **I'm in need of advise on how to move forward, my last chance may be a PayPal chargeback, I used PayPal for all transactions but always as an account recharge.**  Again, I don't know what to expect, but if this issue is not solved by the mods, Ufobuy must be blacklisted in all related subreddits.  I'll keep updating the situation through this post.  Edit: I'm sorry for the misunderstanding that I caused for the mods of this sub, I shared this post from r/repbudgetsneakers and expected a cross post but reddit probably changed the sharing system.;;this is the first time I even heard of UFOBUY lol","{upvote:244,timestamp:2022-10-18}",Reddit,0,

Hermes,quality,"Is this Hermes sweater legit Hi, I got this sweater as a gift from my uncle who bought it in an airport, either Heathrow airport in the UK, Queen Alia Airport in Jordan or Erbil Airport in iraq. I couldnt find it anywhere online so was just wondering if its real or fake. The quality seems good and it came with a hermes bag, and the QR code on the labels worked.

Hey, everyone. So about 50% of the links in my last finds list are dead. That just means you gotta cop these fast before they're out, too. Fresh finds, more stores! Took me 7 straight hours on Weidian to curate this list. Some are pretty unique pieces that I haven‚Äôt seen on the sub before. A couple of the items I always see on instagram fashion pages.  &nbsp;  Here are some of my personal favourite picks. Note that these finds follow my style, so you'll notice that these are subtler/more unique pieces. I also like pastel/earthy colors, so that might influence what I pick here. Don't consider this list as including everything from these stores. Feel free to discover them yourself.   &nbsp;   With all that said and done, here we go!  &nbsp;  This list will be categorized into:   * Tees/Shirts  * Crewnecks/Sweatshirts/Sweaters  * Hoodies  * Jackets/Windbreakers  * Miscellaneous/Pants  &nbsp;  **Tees/Shirts**  &nbsp;  [Nike Vintage 1972 Tee](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=2534192711) -

I am not claiming to be the first person to find these.  7. Sometimes Weidian sellers forget to update their stocks, so some items might be OOS but show as in stock.  8. Yes, these are Weidian finds only. Why? Because.  9. Read the [weidian guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/9j7tbc/the_complete_weidian_guide_some_finds/) before asking questions.  10. I don‚Äôt know whether these are fantasy or not.   11. By vintage, I mean the style, not specifically when the real design was made.  12.

I finally managed to do a couple of washing cycles for each piece to check how the quality would hold. This review is composed of summer/fall items. I'm 186 cm tall and around 76 kg with wide shoulders. Enjoy and let me know if you have any questions.  EDIT: Thank you for my first award!

While the text, unfortunately, is not straight. Fit like a TTS, perhaps a bit tight on the shoulders.  **Polo Bear Tee** : [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Ij2qt2S)| [In hand](https://imgur.com/a/5yWARnu) | Rating 9/10  Really love this piece, excellent quality on the print. Fit like a TTS.  **Kith Treats Tee** : [QC](https://imgur.com/a/PFzq3sB)| [In hand](https://imgur.com/a/Lk2zko0) | Rating 8/10  This tee has been a lesson to me. To check the grammar. The fabric is truly premium, really thick. And I'm a sucker for cute design coming out from front pockets. But the main problem is on the back, the word ""served"" is missing a letter. Thanks to u/BronzeInKorea22 for spotting the typo. Fit like a TTS.  **Supreme Tee** : [QC](https://imgur.com/a/fPzK2VV)| [In hand](https://imgur.com/a/aEfC4xH) | Rating 8/10  Not an expert but the logo seems alright. Good fabric and color. Fit like a TTS  **RL Striped Tee** : [QC](https://imgur.com/a/LOo7yzR)| [In hand](https://imgur.com/a/s5hZKFl) | Rating 10/10  It was more a wild purchase than anything else. In the end I truly enjoy this tee, good colors and logo. Can't ask for more at this price. Fits like a TTS.  **Lacoste Tee** : [QC](https://imgur.com/a/5S7zd5A)| [In hand](https://imgur.com/a/vNW3RBm) | Rating 3/10  So far this is the most disappointing piece. The material feels like a mix with a high percentage of spandex. Logo is wrong, especially in comparison to some cheap lacoste boxers.  **Stone Island Tee** : [QC](https://imgur.com/a/7qThxVF)| [In hand](https://imgur.com/a/tmrL6LZ) | Rating 7/10  Really like the tee even if it's not a full white. Logo on point. Fits like a TTS.  //////////////  **OFF-White shirt** : [QC](https://imgur.com/a/NZSYYyP)| [In hand](https://imgur.com/a/jKYyo52) | Rating 7/10  For the price I was expecting more. You will have to keep it open since the material is not breathable.  **RL Shirt colored pony** : [QC](https://imgur.com/a/u5GjWzk)| [In hand](https://imgur.com/a/epaBCBx) | Rating 9/10  Good value, the fabric is quite heavy so it's more for fall/winter. Fits like a TTS (regular fit).  **RL Shirt** : [QC](https://imgur.com/a/8w3m5No)| [In hand](https://imgur.com/a/c527Mjo) | Rating 9/10  This one instead has the normal thickness you would expect from the single color pony, really nice texture on the fabric. Fits like a TTS.  //////////////  Stone Island shorts : [QC](https://imgur.com/a/fzUIZYv)| [In hand](https://imgur.com/a/heLPSXM) | Rating 8/10  The fabric is really thick and the badge is well done (it's still worth getting some extra badges just in case). Color doesn't feel washed down (just bad pics). TTS on the tight side since it doesn't stretch too much.  //////////////  **Teddy Jacket** : [QC](https://imgur.com/a/vSA26dZ)| [In hand](https://imgur.com/a/1DQeLOc) | Rating 8/10  The price fully respect the quality of this jacket. Amazing materials and construction. My main problem with this from peltiano is the sizing. To compensate for the length I picked a size too big for me, which results in something too baggy. Contact him for a custom tailoring if you are tall. I will probably sell this and buy another one longer.  //////////////  **Prada Hat** : [QC](https://imgur.com/a/7cCM8qq)| [In hand](https://imgur.com/a/v2wwhlL) | Rating 8/10  I still haven't made up my mind on this. Tomorrow I will see if I can remove the crease by wearing it all day, if not I will edit the score. The quality is really good tho.  **Tommy Hat** : [QC](https://imgur.com/a/2cDebab)| [In hand](https://imgur.com/a/CtZZCz6) | Rating 8/10  Can't ask more for the price. But I wish it had more thickness.  //////////////  **Lacoste boxers** : [QC](https://imgur.com/a/1tFeKyI)| [In hand](https://imgur.com/a/DvpRKS9) | Rating 9/10  The only pair of boxers worth a review for the logo quality since the others are pretty much trash. Solid colors and for the price really nice logo. For sure better than the lacoste tee above. Fits TTS (most of the other boxers in the haul need a size up). Will cop again.;;What country?","{upvote:1,timestamp:2020-09-02}",Reddit,0,

Was 2 years ago so things might have changed but the pair has almost no flaws, except for the see through part but thats barely visible so who cares.   comfort wise it's pretty good but nothing insane, shipping took like 130 days or something but I also only payed like 10 bucks for the shipping.    |SERVICE: 9/10|WEIGHT: IDK|  I found out about agents and looked up the most popular one, that was WeGoBuy at the time so my next purchase was with them.

This pair of foamrunners is stiffer than my back and knees and I thought 'oh in the summer when it's warmer and I just start breaking them in it will be better'. Oh boy was I wrong this thing completely destroyed the back of my foot. Maybe because it's an MX colorway or just the wrong shoe. I do not recommend buying these.  |WEIGHT: IDK|  I bought more but those are all OOS so why review them. WeGoBuy was crazy expensive with the shipping\* and the conversion rate sucked so I searched what the cheapest agent was and that was CSSbuy back then, so then I bought some stuff with them   (\*shipped foamrunner, yeezy 700 waverunner and yeezy 500 shipping costed like 90 bucks)   |SERVICE: 3/10|  SORRY NO PICTURES....

The material is really sturdy and thicc I have no idea if it feels just like retail and if the tags are just like retail, but hey it's a great hat definitely good value for the price.

I bought these for comfort but I got none so I wouldn't recommend them. If you just buy them for how they look, they are ok.

A friend, who has retail, had an L and he said that this hoodie looked good and that even the L was to small for him (he has the same build). So size up twice. It's a thicc hoodie but not double the warmth it's just really heavy which feels good and nice. I would recommend it to buy this hoodie, but be careful with the washing since this thing is so heavy it can wear out faster. And of course only buy it when you need it.   |WEIGHT: 1347g |  I bought a lot more from CCSbuy but those things where OOS.

I have some for a year now and they dont peel or discolor. And in my next haul there will be one with a print. The shirt is sturdy and not see through, it's heavy but not sweaty. The colors match the pictures on the site. 'Is it really perfect' I hear you ask. Well not completely yes the stitching has been perfect for all the shirts but the collar is a bit narrow for the first couple of wears, I was afraid I would stretch it too much and destroy it but that does not happen. After a few washes the shirt will be more flexible but will remain the same fit. This shirt is better than any shirt I have bought from ZARA or ROOTS or G-raw.

I think you can wear this for one or two years but then it's worn out. The color and swoosh look good, the thread in the hood feels cheap. The fit is ok.

I'm a bit tall and skinny but this thing felt really weird. The arms were too short but the torso length was ok. But the monstrosity starts when you look at the collar, that thing has the circumference of.... yeah it's really big. The color does not look like the picture on the site at all, I wanted blue but got a grey hoodie with like the tinniest tint of blue ever. quality wise this thing is nothing special, I gave it to my sister who was happy with it, because who isn't happy with a free sweater.

At the top of the shorts...loose stitching. At the bottom of the shorts...loose stitching. Outside of the pockets..loose stitching. Well you get it, the cutting does not damage the structure or anything so it isn't horrible but it wasn't the best experience.

Spoiler... it did, it was nothing insane but did hurt my finger when restitching it. comfort is okay but the sole might be a bit less stiff as retail, the leather is insane.

I think they will last a year while still giving good comfort. Do know that you might want to size up with the shoes since these take in a bit more space than other insoles. Also size up with the insoles, even when they are too big you can always cut something off. I would recommend these if you have some shoes that need more comfort.  |WEIGHT: 80g|  The service you get from PandaBuy is great, when a product is OOS you get your money back really fast and they will also warn you when things seem fishy. Love the function that you can see QC pics from other people and other products from the same seller. Also the cost calculator actually has some worth since a lot of products have an approximated volume and weight. It's a clean interface and easy to use. It's cheaper and more reliable than a lot of other agents out there.   |SERVICE: 10/10|  GENERAL REMINDER: buying might be cheap but spending nothing is better, save some money for other things in your life. Also just double the price of a product in your head to calculate the shipping costs, if buying now doesn't seem worth it, don't buy it at all even though shipping might be a bit cheaper sometimes.  If you have further questions or something to add just comment and I will probably respond.  Ps. English is not my first language and it's getting late so look through the errors and see the quality reviews that I'm giving lol.

This is stuff I've bought over the past 1.5 years for me and my wife. I tried to include in-hand and QC pics for most items. I used QCSuite for some of these so some of the WTCs are uploaded automatically with the QC pics and may be dead, OOS, or changed prices; I haven't checked all of them. If you need fit pics for anything just drop a comment. Here are my stats:  USA  6ft/182cm  170lbs/77kg  Average build  Prefer oversized fits  Size 44.5-45 in shoes  &nbsp;  ---  &nbsp;  ### Outerwear  **Askyurself Army Puffer** - XL - ¬•388 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/EXkLOYn?nc=1) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/yN39LbQ) - 8/10 - Really love this. Super high quality fabric on the outside. The liner material is a little cheaper feeling than the outside material but still feels fine. Super warm, fits really oversized in the shoulders/bust but cropped in length. Really mad because I found this for a lot cheaper on 1688 (I dropped a link on the in-hand imgur).  **FOG Essentials Puffer** - L - ¬•159 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/IvrqNVw) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/FIkAkfB) - 7/10 - Great for the price but not a premium feeling piece. Like the other puffer, the liner material on this one feels a little cheaper than the outside material. Nice and puffy. Fits really oversized, I wish I had sized down.  **Represent Tartan Wool Flannel** - XL - ¬•255 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/YpAQjDA) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/PIxl0S1) - 9/10 - Amazing quality, one of my favorite reps ever purchased. Only negative I could maybe say is that the liner material feels a little cheap but otherwise it's perfect. Also saw this for cheaper on 1688 after buying -- added link to in-hand imgur link.  **FOG Overshirt** - M - ¬•255 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/WEmZcqu) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/BadLMxa) - 8/10 - Love this, it's kind of a micro-corduroy material that feels really premium. Great for a slightly more dressed up look. The badge on the back was not centered but wife fixed it pretty easily with needle and thread. And you guessed it... seen it for cheaper on 1688 since buying. Added the link to the in-hand imgur.  &nbsp;  ---  &nbsp;  ### Hoodies and Zip-ups  **Yeezy Season 6 hoodies** - L - ¬•288 - Gravel: [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/5wgLttw), Glacier: [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/NkbsNrP), Trench: [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/lnVPGoE) and [In-hand for all of them](https://imgur.com/a/JFG9BwO) - 8/10 - These hoodies are amazing. Extremely heavyweight fabric and material is garment dyed/ringspun to reflect the light in a worn/uneven way similar to how retail is. EXTREMELY oversized. I will be selling these on BST in the next couple days and buying them again in size small. NOTE: Glacier color has a ""dust"" coating to make it look like retail as you can see in QC pics, but it washes off after one machine wash -- recommend hand washing if you want to keep the dusty yellowy look.  **Yeezy Season 6 Zip-ups** - L - ¬•265 - Gravel: [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/905Zn52), Trench: [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/gL6EIkM) and [In-hand for both of them](https://imgur.com/a/TkKgjqD) - 8/10 - Same as hoodies except a little  shorter. Paint on zipper pulls is chipping off a little bit due to machine drying so hang-dry to avoid that. Wife loves these.  &nbsp;  ---  &nbsp;  ### T-Shirts/Polo  **Yeezy Season 6 Core and Gravel Tees** - M - ¬•110 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/zHvLZFD) - 10/10 - These are expensive for basically being blanks but are PERFECT. Insanely soft, great collar, awesome material. Some of my favorite rep shirts. They look way more similar to each other in person, especially after washing. No in-hand pics -- sorry they are in the dirty laundry and I don't feel like digging them out.  **Yeezy Season 5 Beige and Green Cali Sport Tees** - S - ¬•55.00 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/WEFfqIZ) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/kFXlWv8) - 7/10 - Great for the price. Wife likes the super boxy fit on these and they look good with the zip-ups due to the length. Fit is very oversized but cropped.  **Ami Tee** - M - ¬•79 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/Pc4Umzw) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/hvvmX7q) - 6/10 - Not bad for the price. I like the color and the embroidery is not bad. The bottom and sleeves are hemmed slightly off-kilter which leads to some unwanted folds and gathering of fabric in some places but it is very minimal and only noticeable if you are examining it closely. I wouldn't buy again for this price, I am sure it's in a ton of 1688 shops for cheaper.  **Jil Sander Tee** - S - ¬•59 - [QC + WTC + In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/hSmMpWs) - 7/10 - First time buying anything besides shoes from 158sir. This is nice for the price. Feels like a cotton/synthetic blend but still pretty good quality. Collar is very nice. This is in the laundry too so no in-hand pic at the moment.  **Represent Reaper Tee** - XL - ¬•129 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/s7I8Ei6)  and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/xA82UMB) - 9/10 - So fucking good. My favorite graphic tee that I own. Insanely soft, distressing is nice, print is good. Color is probably a little yellower than retail and the collar is not quite as wide but don't care, literally never seen a Represent piece in-person where I live. This batch is all over 1688 for 50 yuan less. in fact, I just shipped a new haul with a bunch of Represent tees/flannels from 1688.  **FOG Essentials Tees** - L - ¬•69.99 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/f8uVQkm) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/zGRk3v7) - 5/10 - Blank and print is nice on these but neck opening is just too big for me. Big neck folks or people that like that kinda fit would probably like em more. Sold on BST.  **FOG Essentials Polo** - M - ¬•69 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/JJRKs83) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/w8BVZQn) - 4/10 - Not bad but fits a little smaller/shorter than size chart. Material is okay but felt just like a T-shirt with polo collar added (maybe that's how retail is?). Sold on BST.  &nbsp;  ---  &nbsp;  ### Bottoms  **Yeezy Season 6 Sweatpants** - M - ¬•210 - Gravel: [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/pDsaxqF), Glacier: [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/m0ic5qO), Trench: [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/FD9lxPa) and [In-hand for all of them](https://imgur.com/a/t9Q6dg7) - 8/10 - All comments about material/weight/color on hoodies apply to these as well. Fit is quite loose and seems similar to retail. Only thing I wish is that ankle elastic was a little tighter/narrower to better rest on the top of the sock versus sliding over it and resting on the shoe. Will be selling these on BST as well to buy a smaller size.  **Yeezy Season 6 Shorts** - L - ¬•49.99 - [QC + WTC + In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/yfsTtQI) - 7/10 -  I guess these are supposed to be the trench colorway but they're not very accurate -- great weight and fabric feels great, surprisingly. Cut is terrible, these are way too long and fit like two awkwardly long tubes on your legs. BUT I cut them a little shorter and gave them a heavy wash to fade the color a little and now I love them.  &nbsp;  ---  &nbsp;  ### Shoes (for me)  **Yeezy 350 V2 Citrin NR** - 46 - ¬•59 - [QC + WTC + In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/go9v6LE) - 9/10 - I have no idea how accurate these are but saw some QCs and people said they looked good for the price. They look great to me; I don't even normally like 350s but I don't mind the look of these. Comfort level is insane -- 100% the most comfortable shoes I own, been wearing them so much. For $9 it's wild. Fits 1 size small to me.  **Yeezy Foam Runner Sand (I think?)** - 45 - ¬•28.30 - [QC + WTC + In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/5kPn8ww) - 7/10 - For this price I have no complaints. I have no idea what retail is supposed to feel like and I have never owned crocs but they are comfy and light. Wife hates these ugly MFs but I don't mind em so I mostly just wear them around the house/yard.  **Stussy x AF1 Low Fossil** - 44.5 - ¬•168 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/bsNuqJO) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/9pOaVNf) - 8/10 - 158sir found some good pairs here. I love these so much, they go with so many fits. The tone of the fabric varies a little on a couple panels between the left and right shoes but it is not very noticeable and I have seen the same thing in h12 QCs recently. They get lots of creases but who cares.  **Nike Dunk Low Medium Curry** - 44.5 - ¬•365 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/GJe28ey) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/KbbwL90) - 8/10 - Love these. I definitely overpaid for them but at the time they were a lot harder to find and H12 was out of stock. Color is better in person. These fit big on me.  **Air Jordan 1 x Travis Scott High** - 44.5 - ¬•540 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/vI7b75P) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/OGxCrRV) - 9/10 - These are OG batch from 91sheep. They're the most expensive reps I've ever bought for myself and also my first Jordan 1s. The quality is amazing and honestly idgaf about hype I just like the design/colors/materials. Note: QC lighting sucks and they are silhouetted in my in-hand pic -- IRL color is lighter and accurate.  **AF1 Sail Swoosh Pack** - 45 - ¬•220 - [QC+WTC](https://imgur.com/a/rxYOfy3) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/Bo4NdIx) NOTE: QCSuite automatically used the TB link I used to purchase but here is yupoo link: https://jyao888.x.yupoo.com/albums/85913803?uid=1&referrercate=248534 - 6/10 - Unfortunately seems like no one else will ever sell these besides Umkao. They're okay, not the worst -- velcro is fine but swoosh shapes are not great and they have a million loose threads -- when you cut them all off more pop up as you wear them. These were my first AF1s so wasn't sure on size and sized up just in case but I shouldn't have -- they're huge. Use them mainly as rain/snow shoes now.  **Adidas Ultraboost 4.0 Triple White** 44.5 - ¬•190 - [QC](https://imgur.com/a/nNU8tqN) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/ciJVQYl) - N/A - From banned seller. Not going to comment on these or promote them, not trying to get banned.  ---  &nbsp;  ### Shoes (for wife)  **Gucci Rhyton** - 40 - ¬•218 - [QC + WTC + In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/0qRg0sR) - 9/10 - The quality on these is insane. Leather is soft and buttery feeling. I am kinda jealous and want a pair but I already have a bunch of beigey shoes. They're technically the male version because they have the gucci logo printed across the back heel. They are also technically fantasy because they are not distressed but that's what wife wanted so I found some without it.  **Chanel Espadrilles** - 40 - ¬•288 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/NTOLpgy) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/bEXHoFM) - 8/10 - Very nice quality on these. Not much to say except I wish I could have found some good ones for cheaper but whatever.  **Chanel Leather Dad-Sandals** - 39 - ¬•555 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/qnmliPn) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/pl4qZVb) - 9/10 - Quality on these is amazing. Little bit pricey but worth it for sure. Wife wears these a ton. Bottoms are hella slippery so get some traction pads.  &nbsp;  ---  &nbsp;  ### Accessories  **Prada Re-Edition 2005 Nylon Bag** - ¬•158 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/Dpp2dGs) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/MnLzAc9) - 9/10 - Exceptional for the price. Did a bunch of research on this one before pulling the trigger; this great for the price and no MIL ANO flaw. Wife loves and wears all the time. I would wear it myself but not stylish enough.  **Louis Vuitton Black Soft Trunk Bag** - ¬•189 - [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/Bm9LzmD) and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/9UOgykY) - 7/10 - For the price, this is nice. Wife owns some retail LV and materials don't compare but the color really makes it unnoticeable. Not much else to say. There were some tiny spots of paint chipped off the chain but dabbing with the point of a sharpie fixed it perfectly.  **Acne Pansy Face Beanie in Charcoal** - ¬•129 - [In-hand + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/6u0Sipg) - 10/10 - Perfect beanie, wore this all winter and can't wait to wear it again. Topacney really nailed these. I have one of these in black from a popular TB seller and it is fine but no comparison. Patch looking a little sideways in this pic but it's straight on head.   **Assorted Necklaces from Carmen** - ¬•36-42 - Basic Chain: [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/Io7KSLW), Edgy Chain: [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/7nXhqfC), Pendant Chain: [QC + WTC](https://imgur.com/a/2sGGKd9), and [In-hand](https://imgur.com/a/x3G4Ydg) for all of them - 8/10 - These are really cool for the price. I am not worried about lead; this seller is well reviewed, we don't wear these all the time, and they don't touch much skin either. They look a lot cooler on wife, I think I look like a chode when I try to pull these off without layering.  ---  &nbsp;  ### Thanks for reading!;;amazing review man. did you go TTS on the gucci rythons? thank you!","{upvote:2,timestamp:2021-08-06}",Reddit,1,1

I live in France, and when I went into a Ralph Lauren store, I came across a really nice sleeveless down jacket. I checked on Husky Reps and saw that they were selling it. I ordered it on Pandabuy, but upon receiving the photos, I realize that it doesn't really look like the authentic one: the width of the stripes is not accurate, neither is the bottom of the jacket, nor the placement of the logo, etc.  I checked the Ralph Lauren websites in the USA and China, but couldn't figure out where Husky Reps took inspiration for their replica. What's weirder is that 0832club is selling the same poorly made jacket.  I'm attaching a photo of the one I ordered and the one I saw in the store. Do you know if it's from an old collection that is no longer available today, or if the jacket never existed at Ralph Lauren?;;Link pls","{upvote:1,timestamp:2024-03-04}",Reddit,0,

The first was shipped out on 7/1 and was delivered on 7/9. The second was shipped on 7/3 and was delivered on 7/11. Everything can be seen [here](https://imgur.com/C8a4z0d). For this haul I wanted to prioritize weidian and GP a bunch of items and get a whole lot more tees.  For those interested in a spreadsheet format with less info that I used while buying the items that can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11NH2Y9LUNRwrPNTfoVUy3T-bd5bxGqcjlGIffGGSPEQ/edit?usp=sharing)  #Stats 5‚Äô8 / 173cm   140 lbs / 63kg   #Items  &nbsp;  #Tees  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God x Nike Air Tee**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?p=iphone&itemID=3344155983&a=b&wfr=BuyercopyURL&distributorId=1458730286&share_relation=11d3a65193ddb3d1_1458730286_1)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/I2IQnIR) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/H6YC64a)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Black  * Price: $11.33  Fits slightly oversized and is a great blank. The only flaw I was able to spot was that the swoosh is slightly too far down on the front compared to retail.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Off-White x Nike ARG A6 Tee**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?p=iphone&itemID=3350395888&a=b&wfr=BuyercopyURL&distributorId=1458730286&share_relation=cd958975ad3270ac_1458730286_1)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/99HXUkD) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/qezdMOG)  * Size: Sized up (L)  * Color: Black  * Price: $12.74  I thought the tacky tux-tee concept was neat and the backprint is really cool as well. The backprint is too high and the swoosh is too small. The off white paragraph on the back of the tee is incorrect. Where it says ‚ÄúAIR FORCE 1‚Äù it is supposed to say ‚ÄúAIRMAX 97‚Äù. The seller sent me two when I ordered one. The tee itself is on a good blank.  **Overall: 8/10**  &nbsp;  **Kith x Champion double logo tee**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.8149145.0.0.63cc5062n21Ppj&id=568756219658&_u=2290lhb96ea1)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/S43nH7y) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/HXjhohF)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: White  * Price: $16.99  I‚Äôm a huge fan of this collaboration between Kith and Champion as I bought the crewneck as well. The gold letters are very reflective in the sun. From what I could tell the tee is practically 1:1. The blank is great and I could definitely see myself buying the other colorways of this shirt in the future.  **Overall: 9.5/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike x Paranoise Tee**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=615980254445)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Yr7LCmw) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/VfRQrro)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Yellow  * Price: $12.46  I needed some colorful but lowkey shirts and this one was really clean. The print looks identical to retail and the only difference I was able to spot was the tag is incorrect. It‚Äôs on a great blank as well.  **Overall: 9.5/10**  &nbsp;  **Off-White Galaxy/Fireworks Tee**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a2126o.11854294.0.0.3f7c4831xWh2uB&id=616216276831)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/XTbnj1U) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/9UKab7x)  * Size: Sized up (L)  * Color: Black  * Price: $16.28  The size chart for this tee is extremely misleading. I would highly recommend sticking to going TTS. After sizing up it is way too oversized and I‚Äôll have to fix it before I can actually wear it. The blank is good but feels weird to wear because the print on the back is actually pretty heavy compared to the front. This tee also isn‚Äôt accurate at all compared to retail as the colors are far too vibrant and the backprint is too small.  **Overall: 7.5/10**  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God Essentials Tees (x2)**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3344820716&pc=3&spider_token=5580)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/fc8bCae) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/vvNeQRP)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Black & Grey  * Price: $8.47 each  These shirts are amazing. The fit is a perfect oversized fit and is light but comfortable for the summer. I couldn‚Äôt pick out any inconsistencies compared to retail and would 100% recommend these.  **Overall: 10/10**  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God Fifth Collection Washed Tee**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=1013080264466754983223&wfr=BuyercopyURL&spider_token=bd49&share_relation=cff0efed57bd553c_1407253425_1)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/YtOarx6) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/Hyl18Ca)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Grey  * Price: $7.76  The shirt on the weidian looks very different than the one I received but overall it still has the standard FOG oversized fit and it's on a pretty good blank.  **Overall: 7/10**  &nbsp;  **AMBUSH SS18 Tee**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=585087128693)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/uAfOHlm) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/9HToYcO)  * Size: Sized down (S)  * Color: Stucco  * Price: $12.42  The tee is pretty nice the blank is decent and looks very similar to retail. Only complaint I have with this tee is that I originally meant for this to be in my haul I shipped out in March and I ordered on 1/29 and it was finally delivered to my warehouse on 4/13.  **Overall: 8/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike Air Jordan Tee**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3404511917&spider_token=36f2)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/wu9D5P2) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/gKZOAxO)  * Size: Sized up (L)  * Color: White  * Price: $5.52  The ‚ÄòA‚Äô is slightly uneven and the blank is very thin but for $5.52 I can‚Äôt really complain.    **Overall: 8/10**  &nbsp;   **Kith Novel Tee**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a2126o.success.0.0.724048317LsmPQ&id=619016013253)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Ba8GUXH) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/5FYnjCc)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: White  * Price: $13.95  I originally had retail in hand and the design was really cool so I knew I wanted a rep so I decided to GP this one. Quality of the blank is decent but doesn‚Äôt really stand up to retail. From what I could see the accuracy is pretty much 1:1 but there‚Äôs so much going on it‚Äôs hard to tell.  **Overall: 8/10**  &nbsp;  **Kith x Russell Athletics Tee**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3383023182&pc=2&spider_token=2019)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/JySjGtU) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/srRIGFg)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Green  * Price: $5.66  This one was a really great surprise. When I originally ordered I wasn‚Äôt expecting much at all for a $5 tee but this one truly is a hidden gem. The blank quality on this is seriously high tier and looks indistinguishable from retail.   **Overall: 10/10**  &nbsp;  #Crewnecks  &nbsp;   **Kith x Champion Double Logo Crewneck**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=573608525239)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/7gtB50K) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/fR2Vpkz)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Navy  * Price: $31.86  As I said before I‚Äôm in love with this collab and the crewneck is absolutely no exception. The rainbow champion logo on the navy blank is great. The embroidery is very high quality as is the blank. Fits slightly oversized. Definitely a recommendation by me.  **Overall: 10/10**  &nbsp;  **UNDFTD x Champion crewneck**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3216294040&spider_token=5556)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Y6A0tpH) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/BidHiPn)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Black  * Price: $24.07  The main complaint I have with this crewneck is that it took just over a month to get to my warehouse. The blank is very comfortable and fits slightly oversized. The undefeated logos are made of a nylon material which feels really weird on your back if you don‚Äôt have a tee underneath.   **Overall: 8.5/10**  &nbsp;  **Stone Island SS20 Crewneck**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4004-22644714030.23.5473562eZth9VX&id=617794723507)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/o3sORb4) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/Bbzqbxz)  * Size: Size up (L)  * Color: Dust  * Price: $21.19  Topstoney really never disappoints. The quality on this is really great and it is light enough to be worn comfortably during the summer.   **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  #Hoodies  &nbsp;   **Off-White x Jordan Hoodie**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a2126o.11854294.0.0.4f6b4831yZIfUN&id=614996487130)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/1g5LGu1) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/9qjkprW)  * Size: Size up (L)  * Color: Black / Grey / Red  * Price: $29.73  Originally when I bought this I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of this piece but I was mostly curious about the back‚Äôs embroidery. I was blown away with how intricate it all is in person. Accuracy wise the trademark symbol on the backprint is too bold but other than that it looks really good. The blank is pretty light but still very comfortable.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Kith x Nike x Lebron ‚ÄúLong Live The King‚Äù Hoodie**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=2607683106)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/9a9d7am) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/3sY52ac)  * Size: Size up (L)  * Color: White  * Price: $13.88  I‚Äôve been looking out for this hoodie for a while now and I‚Äôm not disappointed at all. The blank is made of a canvas-like material but is still pretty breathable and light. The embroidery all looks on point and the rose embroidery on the left arm is beautiful. The embroidery catches the light and reflects it really well. Definitely worth it for the price  **Overall 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God Essentials Hoodie**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=601973842733)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/o3sORb4) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/Bbzqbxz)  * Size: Size down (S)  * Color: Tan  * Price: $30.82  Previously bought the pink 3M hoodie of singor in my previous haul and loved it so I knew I was getting another. It has an amazing oversized fit and has a great quality blank. I would 100% recommend this.  **Overall 10/10**  &nbsp;  #Bottoms  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God Nylon Track Pants**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=616911362615)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/2sn8iCN) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/Sci8Dth)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Black / Cream  * Price: $37.95  These have to be the item of the haul for me. These pants are insanely unique, very high quality, and crazy aesthetically. The pants are made entirely of nylon. The zippers are by far the highest quality I‚Äôve seen on a pair of pants. The buttons on the legs can occasionally come apart however. I‚Äôve found these very easy to style especially with high top shoes (FOG 1s and Jordan 1s especially)  **Overall 11/10**  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God Essentials Sweat Pants**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=602185896853)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/h35bctM) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/M9o3Qr5)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Tan  * Price: $23.76  I ordered a pair of the white essentials sweats from singor in my last haul and was very happy with them so I was very likely to get another. These fit really well and they are very comfortable.  **Overall 8.5/10**  &nbsp;  **Unbranded ‚ÄúRhude Style‚Äù Cargo Pants**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=590197322366)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/c8j6D63) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/8fHsFb5)  * Size: Size up (L)  * Color: Black  * Price: $22.37  Quality of these is pretty good. Material feels nice, zippers are good. The drawstrings are pretty poor but not awful.  **Overall: 8/10**  &nbsp;  **Adidas x Alexander Wang Unreleased Sweatpants**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3047019848&wfr=shop&ifr=shopdetail&spider_token=8de6)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/vcN0LsS) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/YS3AtFl)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Maroon  * Price: $4.23  For $4 these are an insane deal. 100% a hidden gem of weidian. I‚Äôm fairly certain these were slated to be released at one point but didn‚Äôt for whatever reason. The quality of these is damn near close to retail Adidas sweatpants for a small fraction of the price. I would 100% recommend.  **Overall: 10/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike Cargo Pants**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3107923938&spider_token=f1ef&spm=1101.1101.N.N.8cd090d)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/VeUGPcb) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/UeuC224)  * Size: Size up (L)  * Color: Black  * Price: $13.30  Quality wise I would say these are slightly above the previous unbranded rhude cargos on the list. I couldn‚Äôt track down the exact retail pair these are based off of so potentially these are fantasy but no one would know if that‚Äôs the case.  **Overall 8.5/10**  &nbsp;  **Stone Island SS20 Shorts**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=571991582579)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/ayXbMbb) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/5EQfWys)  * Size: Size up (L)  * Color: Black  * Price: $26.81  Top Stoney really doesn‚Äôt miss. I bought two pairs of his SS19 shorts and the only thing separating these from the previous model is that these have a fly zipper which is pretty nice. Otherwise the quality has not changed between models which was amazing to begin with. These are practically 1:1 to retail.  **Overall 10/10**  &nbsp;  **Fog Essentials Mesh Shorts**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3176645213&a=b&wfr=BuyercopyURL&share_relation=0d17b5dee8d77b89__1)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/IlhwG57) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/LsyHaJW)  * Size: Size up (L)  * Color: Cream  * Price: $5.51  These are also one of the many weidian gems I‚Äôve covered in this haul. Insanely cheap yet quality wise it surpassed all expectations. They fit very well and quality wise are great too. They look pretty 1:1 to retail.  **Overall 10/10**  &nbsp;  #Shoes  &nbsp;  **158sir Off-White Serena Williams Airmax 97**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=617943523184)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/p1fxc8a) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/CPzxL8a)  * Size: Had to go .5 down because TTS was OOS (10.5)  * Color: Pink / Neon Yellow / Grey  * Price: $15.42  For the price you absolutely can‚Äôt go wrong with these. Quality wise they easily stand up to retail 97s although they are still plagued by the similar discomfort as them as well. After a long period of walking they do get very uncomfortable especially around the heel. Accuracy wise these are very good even compared to the batches that middlemen are selling for over $100. They have a slightly slanted ‚Äúair‚Äù but everything else checks out.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  #Miscellaneous  &nbsp;  **Travis Scott ASTROWORLD Cap**   **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=579635480850&spm=1101.1101.N.N.e4d7b94)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/ISCIJr0) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/s0EDUqw)  * Size: One Size  * Color: Black  * Price: $2.72  Overall it fits well and the material is comfortable enough for long periods of time. Looks identical to retail and you absolutely cannot go wrong with the price.  **Overall 10/10**  &nbsp;  **Raf Simmons Antwerp Cap**   **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3639724056&wfr=BuyercopyURL&spider_token=9e14&share_relation=2e205cc14d7bd17a__1)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/rrfNiCm) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/nuHBdAi)  * Size: One Size  * Color: Black  * Price: $12.68  The hat looks great only issue is the smiley face is slightly misaligned. The hardware is good as well. A bit on the expensive side for a hat but not unreasonable.   **Overall: 8.5/10**  &nbsp;  **Stone Island Ghosted Logo Cap**   **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3688169890&spider_token=5dea)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/o1FawRl) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/PHvUtsb)  * Size: One Size  * Color: White  * Price: $7.76  Hat fits well, the logo is aligned, the hardware is good, this store has a lot of really good stuff I would recommend looking through it.   **Overall 8.5/10**  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God Sixth Collection Suede Cap**   **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=1013080264466673136842&wfr=BuyercopyURL&spider_token=dd33&share_relation=cff0efed57bd553c_1407253425_1)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/K4GefE1) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/9mPJQAJ)  * Size: One Size  * Color: Grey  * Price: $7.33  The quality of the materials on this is way better than I expected. Suede is very wavy. Slightly bent up in shipping but it‚Äôs getting better over time.  **Overall 9.5/10**  &nbsp;  **Dior Composit 1.0 Sunglasses**   **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=610198142308&spm=1101.1101.N.N.7a5e624) Alternatively you could go through Markin‚Äôs Wechat for direct shipping  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/G9BzU7N) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/gallery/5XbiQf7)  * Size: One Size  * Color: Silver  * Price: $36.00  These are really great. They really are UV protected. The hardware on these feels amazing and well above what I would‚Äôve expected. They block out a good amount of sunglasses similar to my retail Raybans. Only complaint I have about these is that there is a weird effect in the peripherals, especially noticeable when driving, where they are very reflective and you see behind you and can occasionally be distracting.  **Overall: 9.5/10**  &nbsp;  #Conclusion  Dig around weidian because there's tons of good shit out there. I‚Äôm also willing to send out additional photos to those interested as well.;;Please update the FOG Hoodie links as they're linking to a Stone Island Hoodie.

,"quality,haul,comparison","Rep vs. retail: Represent Owner‚Äòs Club Tee UnionKingdom Hi guys, thanks to the Represent Black Friday sale I ordered some OC shirts, so I can compare them to the ones I ordered from Union Kingdom.  General: Powder blue is UK, the‚Äúgreener‚Äú one is retail. UK is size S, retail XXS. You can compare them directly because they have the exact same dimensions: ~54 cm (1/2 bust) and 70-71 cm length  Fit: as mentioned before, dimensions are the same, fit is perfect on both of them. Retail neck is a tiny bit tighter, but UKs is worn several times, so maybe that‚Äôs the reason. Not noticeable.  Quality & weight: both are premium, I personally don‚Äôt feel a difference materialwise, both super soft and the structure of the material looks identically. Rep is a little heavier, 237 v 220, could be because of different colours.  Backprint: it‚Äôs nearly impossible to get a rep with good back placement. UK nailed it. Check the pictures, letters have the same height, placement is almost the same, retail print is a little bit more compact, but definitely not noticeable.  Front print: the biggest flaw in my opinion, rep is a little bigger, placement is very good. I doubt that anybody could identify this.  Metal Tag: very very good  Inside tags: no ‚ÄûEngland‚Äú what you can see on almost every rep, so definitely ok (I don‚Äôt care about the inside tags but want to mention it)  Conclusion: really impressed with the quality and the accuracy of the shirt, a very good tee which feels amazingly. Retail is usually 115‚Ç¨, the rep is ~20‚Ç¨ and 28‚Ç¨ with insurance and shipping in a standard haul to Germany.  P.s. I am not paid for this review, never got any discounts or something like that. Unionkingdom doesn‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm doing a rep vs retail.  Hope you enjoyed this little comparison. Feel free to ask for further information.  W2C: Union Kingdom yupoo;;On the first look it does the job pretty well, but the print cracks very fast whereas the retail holds up very well. You can tell that the print is not made in same way. Otherwise, they would be great.","{upvote:3,timestamp:2023-12-05}",Reddit,1,0

It looks ok when not compared to auth as the shape too square.

Couple minor downers is a few loose threads inside the hood where cotton is coming out and the zip isn‚Äôt matte like the metal drawstring end should be, the rep‚Äôs is too shiny.

Still waiting for these in hand because I RL'd a few pairs. I was comparing Coco's GD batch and LJR batch, and I liked Coco's GD batch better. I had to RL a few pairs, but the pair I GL'd looks almost perfect based on the pics. I've heard that Coco renames batches because they are so popular and can get away with it. Even if it's just some random batch that is renamed GD, I think they are better than LJR. The reverse swoosh and midsole colors, the heel tab shape, and the Air Jordan logo on the heel tab are all better imo. Impressed with the toebox, because it's not thick at all. Tumbled leather looks good. My one complaint is that the reverse swoosh should sit a little lower. That is one thing that LJR tends to get better. Not worried because retail reverse swooshes vary too.](https://preview.redd.it/fcu65uwjs1l81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cb4d452674a169ee3f04fbc6e318a7f855142c5);;GREAT review!

"Zara,Chanel","price,haul","Yet another Arabian Perfume Oil haul - Creed, Tom Ford, Chanel Hello again!  For those new to the rep perfume scene, this topic is a review of perfume oils - basically perfume without the alcohol that you can apply directly to your skin or make into a normal perfume, lotion, shampoos, candles, you name it. I have been in this ""world"" for about half a year now, I've tried several shops from the US to Kuwait, some of them I've reviewed here before, must mostly over at Fragrantica (perfume forum).  **Store**: Arabian Perfume Oil (link is not whitelisted, GIYF)  **Price**: ¬£73.99 \~ $83 shipped for 10 12ml bottles (I split the order with a friend) - each 12ml bottle can give you about 60ml worth of ""normal perfume""  Ordered on the 19th, shipped on the 21st, received on the 25th (Portugal)  **Picture of the bottles**: [https://i.imgur.com/sMPnPos.png](https://i.imgur.com/sMPnPos.png)  Review  **Tom Ford London** \- if you enjoy Oud Wood or you think the scent is a bit too ""nose piercing"", you HAVE to try London - it's basically a burnt (in a good way) Oud Wood. I've tried another replica of this one, the scent was similar but it had the same ""piercing"" effect OW has, so that's why I went with APO's version.  **Tom Ford Tuscan Leather** \- I have tried about 5 versions. None came even close to APO's version, but none goes close to the OG, which I believe is due to reformulations, making Tuscan Leather more leather than raspberry. Nonetheless, the drydown of APO's oil is spot on, while the opening is sweeter than the OG (2019 batches).  **Chanel Paris Venise** \-  unisex but more towards the female side as one expects from Chanel. The original has poor longevity, I didn't notice that with the oil, tends to stick on and stay for the whole day. For me, I bought it as an office frag. Can't recommend checking it out enough, the scent is just something else.  **Tom Ford Plum Japonais** \- unfortunately the OG is not available at my local Sephora/Nordstorm-equivalent, but the scent is amazing. Imagine Tuscan Leather, but instead of Raspberry you have Plum and instead of Leather you have Amber. I dislike Amber fragrances, but here it's just amazing, a night scent that's sweet but ""with a soul"" due to the amber background. If there's a perfume that I feel you should try from this list, it's this one.  **Aventus Creed** \- I mean, it's the classic, who doesn't have an Aventus clone? I've tried several, the ones that actually try to copy it (oils) and the ""inspired"" mass market fragrances, like Montblanc Explorer, Zara Vibrant Leather, etc. The Montblanc is nice, but this oil is amazing, the right amount of Pineapple followed some the birch/musk combo. A must buy, it's the Goyard wallet of perfume reps that's for sure.  Let me know if you have any doubts, they are still working and from what they told me, they will only stop if any of them gets infected or the Royal Post stops working.   UPDATE: They seem to have closed down for the time being due to the obvious reasons. All other oil vendors that I know are closed, so we'll have to wait :(;;So you just add 4x the amount of mL in alcohol to make the perfume?","{upvote:2,timestamp:2020-03-25}",Reddit,0,

I first discovered the  [**FashionReps**](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/)  community last month, and I felt like I discovered a new world. Prior to this, I have always been a loyal supporter of luxury high quality. Here I want to post my first review here. I bought this Hermes from Non-TS LUXEcollection. I bought it from her for several years. It cannot be said that every time is a perfect transaction, but she is a trusted seller and has always been very friendly.  Rose Tyrien is the eye-catching shade of pink in the famous candy series launched by Hermes in 2011. It has always been the brightest and most neon shade of Hermes tracks. It actually glows under black light. You will find that you once brought this bag to the club!

Color and leather- The color and texture look exactly like what I see online and in a second-hand boutique that specializes in Herm√®s handbags.  Inside- the inside of the zipper is kept horizontal and the leather lining is very soft. There is a smell of leather. There is no rancid smell and factory smell.  Stamp is copy from the real Hermes Kelly bag with same series.  **Satisfaction: 10/10**  No language can describe this perfect bag. Carry it in the mall, passersby‚Äôs return rate is basically 100%  **Seller Communication and Service: 9/10**  As her frequent visitor, if you leave a message on WeChat, LUXEcollection respond quickly. She can speak English. She will send you photos of the factory and give you everything you want. Usually shipped on the same day after payment. Sometimes she doesn't reply to you because she has a baby over 1 year old to take care of. The express delivery is usually DHL and FedEx. (FedEx is slower but safer) Her prices are fair. Excellent quality. She will answer any questions.  Anyway, I hope this review is helpful to you.

"LV,Hermes,Gucci","quality,price","Hermes bracelet, Gucci ring and LV Supreme bottle opener keychain from HLin Jewelry ### W2C  * WhatsApp:  +86 156 2702 2716  * Website:  hlinjewelry.x.yupoo.com  * Instagram:  hlinjew_official   * WeChat:  SAMHO-ZXH  * Mention REPREVIEW for $5 off  ### REVIEW   The Hermes bracelet looks imo identical to retail. The only thing I noticed and based on only photos is that the sticker on the inside band isn't on retail, but can easily be taken off. The clasp and H clic work very well and don't get stuck and are easy to unclasp. Material feels good, and there's a good weight to it. Sizing is TTS. I went with the 21cm one.   * Price:  $50  The Gucci ring fits TTS, and from what I can tell, it is real silver. I did a lead and magnet test on it, and both were negative. The engravings on the outside and inside are decent, and the skull engraving looks good. The dot engravings between the GGs should be a little thicker and bolder. Overall, it was a very well-done rep.   * Price:  $50  The LV supreme bottle opener keychain, from what I can tell based on comparing them to photos, looks good. The LV engravings on the base are placed well but not as clean and clear as retail. The LV text on the key ring looks spaced well and placed evenly. The LV engravings on the clip looks clean and has good size and placed well. Also tested this for lead, and it came back negative. Overall, a solid LV keychain rep.  * Price:  $38  ### Experience with Seller  This is my third time dealing with HLin and communication and responsiveness was good. They answered all my questions and QC and shipping was very fast. I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for quality jewelry reps with great customer service.   Let me know what you think and if I missed anything.;;Hermes Link ?","{upvote:1,timestamp:2024-02-21}",Reddit,0,

,"waste,quality,price,worth it,haul,opinions","[UK] [Review] Mini 4.5KG Winter Haul (The North Face, Tom Ford, Balenciaga) Hey All,  Just got my 1st part Winter haul for some of the colder months here in the UK, thought I'd write up a review with my opinions based on what products i received.  https://preview.redd.it/f3aqkc7o0kwb1.jpg?width=6048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e5d7a9b5acded88a6cedbeaa960b5fd4b9eceef  **Stats & Info:**  186cm, 88KG (195.6pounds), Trained in the gym for 4+ Years and fresh out of a bulk so sat at around 20% BF Broad build for context.  Tee Size: Oversized M, Normal L  Hoodie Size: Oversized M, Normal L/XL depending on fit.  Waist: 35""  **Location:** United Kingdom.  &#x200B;  **Haul Info & Agent:**  **Agent - Pandabuy** \- Quick shoutout to Pandabuy, shipped plenty of Hauls using them and their customer service has been second to none! Been with them a few years now and honestly always helpful in the discord, even answering my questions as its the first time I've tried any of the UK lines outside of using EMS and they were quick to respond, good photos and aftercare as well with coupon code giveaways etc!   price and Weight:  &#x200B;  [Total item cost: 1221 Yuan +  389.20 Yuan shipping via UK Packet \(Actual Weight\)](https://preview.redd.it/f6v11l121kwb1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e37edafe7a3e76dfea4a9086db0f828caf40191)  Item Declaration - Used Pandabuys Declaration form but total parcel was declared at 40GBP split equally among the items based on the category set by PB.  **TTS - Time To Ship** was around 7days in Transit from submitting to the parcel arriving at my door! Gotta say that this is by far the fastest shipping handling time i've had for a parcel coming from China; really impressed with UK Packet and my next shipment will be sent via that route as well!  &#x200B;  **Contents of Haul:**  &#x200B;  ***The North Face Gillet - Size XL - Colour: Black - Price: 358 Yuan***  Link: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=699403997662](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=699403997662)  | [https://www.pandabuy.com/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D730167018182](https://www.pandabuy.com/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D730167018182) (This is either Husky / 0832 Club, you can confirm via their yupoo)  Review: 700 Down gillet you see all over this sub - the quality is solid and can't see any obvious issues with the down placement throughout the pockets of the jacket - checked all of the zips which seem smooth, hood and labels are correct and honestly solid all around  Only issue for me was sizing; this is slightly too small around the upper chest for me and as a result; this will be listed over on FashionRepsBST subreddit tonight for sale and ill order a size up!  Overall Rating: 9.5 - knocking the .5 off for the size chart issue otherwise this would be spot on, product itself is solid from what i can see.   &#x200B;  **The North Face Mountain Gore-Tex Jacket - Size L - Colour: Black - Price: 328 Yuan**  Link: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=699403997662](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=699403997662)  [https://www.pandabuy.com/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D699403997662](https://www.pandabuy.com/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D699403997662) (This is either Husky / 0832 Club, you can confirm via their Yupoo as i ordered one item from each of the sellers out of their TNF collection).  Review: Yeah imma cut straight to the end point - MVP of the haul, quality of this jacket is miles better than i expected, the zips feel solid, no loose stitching, hood has some solid weight and good design to it, the buttons are firm and don't feel like they will pop off after zipping up the jacket; sleeves and TNF embroidery / GoreTex embroidery is absolutely spot on.   The fleece like lining inside the jacket is solid even when wearing just a T-Shirt underneath; sizing is TTS as i could easily fit a hoodie under this jacket with the extra room at the top of the shoulders and the lower bust section. Plenty of pockets in and out of the jacket and i can confirm i tested the jacket with the following:  Exposure to light mist / rain - Goretex performance 10/10  Exposure to steady rain - Goretex performance 10/10  Heavy Rain - TBC; not heavy raining atm in the UK so will update this once i've had the chance to, im not expecting it to hold out for a long period of time and i will be purchasing the Gore-Tex mist on amazon to soak the jacket in every 3/4 months to prolong the GoreTex coating on the jacket; the spray is 100% worth it and use it on my retail TNF Goretex walking boots, 3 years strong with that spray coating.  Overall Rating: 10/10 for the money (its 30 yuan less than the Gillet which is insane to me) - MVP of the haul.  &#x200B;  ***Balenciaga Heavy Duty Embroided Hoodie - Size M(Oversized) (Seller: THUNDER) - Cost 325 Yuan***  Link: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6525412100&spider\_token=4572](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6525412100&spider_token=4572)  Review: I ordered Size S in my last haul and unfortunately was a bit too small, so just reordered a size up and the review below still stands:  Honest to god the best quality REP ive ever owned in my life - the price is quite steep but my lord its worth every penny - the blank is heavy and quality, the outward facing seams on the shoulders and waist make the hoodie look distressed; match this with the washed black colour and it makes such a nice piece in the winter months. Embroidery for the front logo and writing is on point, not a loose stitch out of place and honestly for the actual quality of the hoodie i couldn't be happier.   Overall rating: 10/10   &#x200B;  ***Tom Ford Boxer Briefs - Size XL;Black and Grey (Seller: BANNED SELLER: M3dusa) - Cost: 210 ; bartered him via WeChat***  Link: Banned seller so won't be promoting him, all contact was done via WeChat - Took the risk as he's never personally done me wrong so can't complain; would advise others to be careful with him and won't be publicly promoting his store as a result.  bit of info first: M3dusa was well known on this community but did some shady stuff and is now banned - always bought stuff from him directly via WeChat and barter him down as he does the typical seller thing of highballing; he knows that i don't waste his time so we get to an agreement usually pretty quickly (this time he didn't reply for weeks but got there in the end..)  PLEASE NOTE PANDABUY WILL NOW NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM HIS STORE; BLACKLISTED.  Review: Honestly bought some of these in my last haul and by far the best boxers he offers, the length is actually correct from boxers as you would expect and the room for the golden berries is spot on; plenty of support but not enough to where i feel like I'm losing feeling in that region via suffocation! Would buy more when i go through the effort of dealing with him again.  &#x200B;  Thanks all for tuning in, hope you enjoyed.  Dan - RootsReps420.  &#x200B;;;Great reviews cheers - did anyone manage to confirm if it was 0832C or Husky for the Jacket?  Edit - it‚Äôs husky.","{upvote:2,timestamp:2023-10-26}",Reddit,1,1

Tommy Hilfiger,quality,"[Review] Blackcat Canada Goose Chilliwack Bomber Jacket - Color Black - Size L As many of you want to know more about the quality and the looks of Blackcats CG Jackets especially of his Chilliwack, this will be an in detail review :)  To start with I want to talk about Blackcat as a seller:  **#1 Service:**  Blackcat is a really trustworthy seller who is really calm and cares about his customers as well as about this community. Ordering this Jacket was pretty easy, however I had to deal with bad badges. However it was not a problem at all to exchange the faulty jacket and get a new one. Even better is the fact that you can ask for IN ADVANCE QC PICTURES.  Yes, many of you know but there are still people who don't. So it's possible for you to tell him the order number via WeChat or via your agent and ask for QC pictures before shipping the product. That way you can assure that you won't get wonky badges and bad fur ;)  &#x200B;  Shipping the actual Jacket was very fast. It only took 1 day from shipping until reaching my warehouse.  &#x200B;  **#2 Overall Quality**  Blackcat's Chilliwack feels sturdy and well buildt. You won't find any loose threads or down leaking.  Everything looks and feels clean.  However I have the feeling that the outside material is a bit thinner than retail. I don't know if this has an effect on the warmth of the jacket or the waterproofness...  &#x200B;  **#3 Badge Quality**  I think we can all agree and there is no denial that Blackcat has, at least for now, the best Badge that gets the closest to retail. Let me tell you why:  1. The distance between leaves and letters is small like on retail. If there is much spacing like on BC Freestyle Vest or on StoneStores badge you can callout the badge pretty easily. 2. The thickness of the leaves is almost same as on retail. It's a tiny bit thicker but you can't notice it in person. It's MUCH better than Feiyu's thicc leaves ;) 3. Sun/Compass and the Island does not touch. I know this happens on retail too sometimes but I want to mention it anyways ;) 4. Quality of the letters is consistant, stitching is well done.  &#x200B;  **#4 Fur Quality**  The fur quality varies from jacket to jacket. That's because it is of course real fur from real animals who aren't equal of course ;)  My jacket has a decent fur. It could be better to be honest. It looks crinkly but still good. Colorwise it could be a bit more yellowish but as I said before, it's totally random what you'll get.  The fur has a slight smell to it which doesn't bother me at all. It just smells like any fur does :)  &#x200B;  **#5 Down Quality**  This is probably the most interesting point for many of you since there was a review about BC's Expedition Jacket where a person cut open the Down pockets to reveal the quality of the filling.  He said he is not sure what type of down is used or if it's real down at all or some kind of synthetic fibres.  &#x200B;  I can assure you that, at least for the Chilliwack, Blackcat uses real Down for the filling :)  Why? Because I took some down and put it under my macro lens ;)  Therefore please have a look at the Imgur Album!  &#x200B;  **#6 Warmness**  Since temperatures in Germany didn't drop below 0¬∞C yet I could only test it at about 3¬∞C...  Result: The jacket is warm. To be more specific: it's more warm than my $400 retail Tommy Hilfiger Down Jacket.  1. The pockets are lined so your hands stay warm 2. The down pockets are filled very well so the whole jacket keeps you warm 3. The fur is extremely helpful to protect your ears from cold wind  &#x200B;  **#7 Fitting**  Here comes the point where maybe many of you will be left unsatisfied...  ...The jacket is slightly too small for my comfort. Especially the arm lenght bothers me. You will see what I mean if you have a look at the Fit Pics.  Why I am bothered?  I am 187cm tall, my weight is 76kg.  Usually I wear size M or L in Jackets. For BC I went with size L and it's still too small.  That's why I ordered the Jacket one more time in size XL...so stay tuned ;)  &#x200B;  **#8 Conclusion**  For just 799Y you'll get an awesome Canada Goose Chilliwack Rep with all the necessary details, a basically 1:1 badge as well as real wolf/coyote fur and real down filling.  &#x200B;  What do you want more? :)  &#x200B;  [Detailed Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/gBacL6a)\*  [Fit Pics](https://imgur.com/a/nt8A5Z1)\*  [W2C Yupoo](https://blackcatstudio.x.yupoo.com/albums/73311285?uid=1)  [W2C TaoBao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a2oq0.12575281.0.0.25911debNDIFnq&ft=t&id=607426557009)  &#x200B;  \*Pictures have slight red tint.

Review : the tee look very good , it‚Äôs long have accurate color good printing really oversize like how it should be , it‚Äôs from the same factory sold by anton for x2 the price as you can see it‚Äôs only 180Y the only bad thing about it that it‚Äôs also creasing like a paper! So put that in your mind , the lv bracelet is good and match my outfit but it‚Äôs fantasy design!  5th fit :  https://imgur.com/a/rJU5iOf   W2C : 1 - t shirt/ fakeLab OOS 2 - pants/ asos 3 - shoes/ dunk VT https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4415766195&spider_token=4572 4 - bracelet/ LV new collection https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=5377579164&spider_token=4572 5 - others/ check the previous review.  Review : these t-shirt i don‚Äôt know , sometime i really love it sometimes i don‚Äôt the print is high quality always get complements when i wear it but the fit is weird ( maybe because it‚Äôs S size ) , also i think the neck should be little tight for off white , if you want to order from fake lab you will wait 2-3 weeks until it will get to you but overall he is the best for off white , nike dunk my only dunk i‚Äôve ever have and own in my whole life but good as a beater the shoes little tight i read comment from someone who say go tts on VT dunk and i do , wish i didn‚Äôt and i go half size up instead, the bracelet is good love it been looking for it a lot until i found it randomly with these seller.   6th fit :  https://imgur.com/a/Sc8nsoR  W2C :  1 - shirt/ was send to me from some seller to promote him  2 - pants/ https://detail.1688.com/offer/681489886880.html 3 - others/  check the previous reviews.  Review : before 2 years some seller ( not in these community ) send me the gucci sweatshirt to promote him but i didn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs so bad the fabric is bad also the crewneck is wide and not hanged on my neck like how it should thats why i always say ( don‚Äôt go budget for designers items ) i was doing that but never wear it again because it‚Äôs very easy called out.   I have more than 20 fit pics but it take from me a lot of time to give you my honest opinion for each item i will do posts like these to help you all , it‚Äôs one of the better things happened to me that i know these community it took me to another level in fashion i was don‚Äôt care about my outfits before but now everyone i know talk about how i changed.   as a advice for you all guys and kids :  don‚Äôt spend too much + don‚Äôt buy something doesn‚Äôt equal to your economic income + don‚Äôt buy something you don‚Äôt like just because it‚Äôs trend + just buy what you need and what you think it will be good on you + don‚Äôt be Gate Keeper ( you was someday here don‚Äôt know anything but you learn from the others as a pay back learn them and give them your finds and honest thought‚Äôs it will give you great trust in yourself )   Thank you all..;;it‚Äôs nice to see some high effort posts even if I don‚Äôt have the same taste :)","{upvote:2,timestamp:2022-12-27}",Reddit,1,1

I will divide review into 2 parts. Perfumes i have  owned/smelled in retail and ones i did not.  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Lets start with the ones i know !**   &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Dior - Sauvage**  Okay who does not know Dior Sauvage must be living under a rock. When i was smelling a cap of it i was like damn this is nowhere real one and at the same time i was on WhatsApp chatting with Peracar giving him my opinion on perfumes i just got. Moment i sprayed Sauvage i wrote to him that bro its really bad . It has really strong strong citrus opening nothing like retail. Peracar told to me chill and let it grow on me so i did. After 20 min when it starts to dry down you start to smell and recognise typical ambroxene scent. Citrus smell is gone in like 30 mins and dry down really smells like Dior Sauvage, not like Dior Sauvage EDT but like Parfum (not EDP) it really comes close to retail thing and i maybe like it more than retail EDT i own,   **Verdict : 8,75/10 - COP !**  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Versace - Eros**   Okay to keep it short it is same same same as retail. It has same synthetic sweet smell like real one and i have already wrote short post where girl recognised this one and gave me compliment that this is her most favorite smell on men. It is oos atm.  **Verdict : 10/10 - COP !**   &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Chanel - Bleu de Chanel**  Again opening is strong citrus bomb that will give you hard time lol. After the dry down citruss smell remain but Quite a lot, not like retail where citruss is still present in dry down but it is subtle and notes like bergamot comes out. It is similiar to retail, i wear it from time to time, so it is not bad smelling juice.  **Verdict : 6,5/10 - I would say 50/50**  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **DG- The One**   Short one, ye its really close to retail , Sweet bomb, i gave it to my friends so i cannot tell much about it . Not my style but neither is retail  **Verdict : 8,5/10 - COP if you like retail**  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Tom Ford - Fucking Fabulous**  Okay we jump from designer to niche. First time i have smelled this one i was like wtf,**1:1** **headache + nausea.** Sweet sweet, it really comes strong on opening while retail i had sample of is also strong but not headache giving. After few wears and it really grew on me so this was my no. 2 after Eros. Opening between these two is really close but leather smell is not that prominent, Tonka bean same. On dry down its similiar , close enough that i couldnt tell much of a difference when i have retail on one wrist and rep on other . There is difference but i cannot describe it.   Fun Fact : I gave this one to my best friend as one of wedding presents since he fell in love with it. He even wore it on His wedding üòÇ  **Verdict : 8,5/10 - COP !**  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Tom Ford - Tuscan Leather**   My dumbass broke the glass so rip no review  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Creed - Green Irish Tweed :**  Okay these one is worst of all, its like soap, nothing else but a soap. I had to get bad batch or something because people here have been praising it a lot. I will re-order it but the one i got is sh\*t  **Edit: As I said i know it has to be some production mistake, other reviews said it is pretty close so go on and order, it Is really beautiful scent**  **Verdict : 1/10 - Bad Batch**  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Yves Saint Laurent - La Nuit de l¬¥Homme**  I was really hyped for this one since its been 3 years since i had this one in retail. Expectations did not meet reality and i was dissapionted, it does smell .. decent ?  Maybe for someone who didnt have retail one.   **Verdict : 5/10 - Good smelling but not close to retail**  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Creed - Viking**  Okay now this is a **MVP !** Moment i have smelled it just from cap i knew it is like real thing  ! Moment you spray it you will smell combination of Cinnamon + Mint and Spicy pepper ! Just like real thing, this will be your most unique smell ever. Just to think that you get 300euro perfume for 10 euros is insame . One small problem is that the Mint note is not that strong like on retail but not a big deal  **Verdict : 9,5/10 - COP (-0,5 for that mint)**  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Tom Ford - Oud Wood**  Same opening, it gave me Deja Vu when i have smelled opening of it. But more it dries down more you can smell little diffenrence betweed retail and rep. Quality of scent is not the same but main texture is pretty spot on.  **Verdict 8/10 - If you like Oud/Wood perfumes COP**  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Dior - Hypnotic Poison**   Okay this one is women perfume that i have bought for my gf, i know this one very good since my mother have used it and even I have used it when i was little penguin on highschool lol. Perfomance on this one is strong af, could be the strongest one of all. Sweet/Fruity/Vanille scent really pleasant and spot o  **Verdict 10/10- COP for your gf mother or even for yourself**  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Creed - Aventus**  Okay king of kings blah blah... If you have ever smelled CDNMI this one has same same same citrussy opening dont look for pineapple opening. On the dry down difference between this and CDNMI is that perfume guys is more fruity than CDNMI whic hhas green/smookey dominant smell  **Verdict : 8/10 as it smells good ! 6/10 in terms of being close to retail one**  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Chanel - Coco Mademoiselle**  Defo cop for your gf, close to real thing i could not tell the difference. GF/friends GF love it to death  **Verdict : 10/10 - COP if you want that 1:1 bj**  &amp;amp;#x200B;  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Now Perfumes i cant compare to real thing**  **Creed - Silver Mountain Water**  From what i have read/heard on YouTube, internet .. Silver Mountain Water should be lighter version of GIT with aquatiq core. Does it compare to that ? Hmm i would say yes, it really has green notes to in it but really subtle. Is it good smelling perfume ? Fuck yeah, 1:1 wise i would say it is similiar but not same perfume  **Verdict : 8.5/10 COP**  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Tom Ford - Black Orchid**  I have smelled retail but not perfume guys one since i bought it for GF , and since i did not have chance to smell it, from what i have hear it smells good but i cannot review it :/  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Verdict : ?**  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Lancome - La Vie est Belle**   Now this is good fucking smelling perfume, it got me thinking that i should be careful with copping perfumes for my gf because boys might be trying to slide into DMs when they smell that perfume. Strong sweet fruity ! Defo cop, looks like Women perfumes are way better damn  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Verdict : 10/10**  &amp;amp;#x200B;  **Viktor and Rolf - Flowerbomb**  Again cant compare to retail but its good smelling perfume defo a cop  &amp;amp;#x200B;  &amp;amp;#x200B;  My fin√°le words   **Perfumes are really worth buying since you get at least decent smelling perfume for fraction of real price**  **Perfumes really projects well off my skin and has longetivity of at least 6-8 Hours !**  **So fucking go and get some for yourself ! Its really worth it**  **You won‚Äôt get no succ when you smell like üí©, finesse your dripp with some good smell**  I have changes SMW to 8.5 since it smells damn good cant be 7.5","{upvote:192,upvoteRatio:0.97,timestamp:2020-01-19}",Reddit,1,1

"Ralph Lauren,Tommy Hilfiger",quality,"Man In Motion Crash, boom, bang! Out on the town. A touch of gloom gave way to bloom, but then the cold set in. Hitting it hard today with a fit of fun. Multiple patterns stacked to the sky. It shouldn‚Äôt work, but it does. Never be afraid.    Breakdown:   Coat: Pierre Cardin   Was not crazy about this belted wide chevron herringbone raglan when I received it, but now I‚Äôm killing this coat by wearing it every day. Very unique wool in this one and a fantastic length.    Shirt Jacket: Polo Ralph Lauren   Super cool Wool and Alpaca blend. Wild check pattern. On its own, it‚Äôs probably not my thing stylistically as the shirt jacket thing is weird to me. For layering, it‚Äôs great. Adds that pop.    Rollneck: Polo Ralph Lauren   All these layers kept me dripping in more ways than one. I love this funky 70s red. Hard one to wear, but I‚Äôve just gone with it.    Scarf: Polo Ralph Lauren   Yep. Classic navy US flag knit. Pure wool, but actually one of the worst RL scarves I own from a quality angle.    Silk scarf: Vintage   No brand. Old, ripped. I caught it in a zipper years ago, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt wear it.    Bandana: Christian Lacroix   Neat. Sometimes I use it as a pocket square, but today it had to be worn up top.    Beret: Unbranded   Having a tough time finding a replacement for this one. I like it for being big and poofy. As such, I wear it uhh‚Ä¶ army style?   Jeans: Levi‚Äôs   The old school button fly, high waisted, relatively straight fit vintage 522.    Sunglasses: Tommy Hilfiger   Big boy aviators. Good times.    Bag: Polo Ralph Lauren   The old school polo messenger. Definitely needed on this outing.    Socks: Pantherella   Love this pinstripe knee high socks. Super fun and comfortable.    Shoes: Crockett & Jones   Classic single monk in dark brown. Comfortable but my feet began to feel it after hours of walking.;;Arguing in the comments will result in a ban.

I went into store and tried on the auth and it was perfect. * From memory the color of the gold looks the same as the one I tried in store. It comes with a custom gold certificate from China as well!  * The  clasp feels secure. I don't think I will have an issue with it. I ask for PSP video of opening and closing the clasp just in case   **Accuracy -** 10/10  * Font - the font looks the same as the ones i have come across in my research, carat weight is diff for different size bracelet. The sizing of the font looks 100% accurate. The depth of the font looks perfect; not too faint or too deep. * Width - the width of the bracelet appears to be the same as in store * Color - the color looks perfect, it doesn't look too light, yellow, or pink which is in line for 18k yellow  * Diamonds - accurate in my opinion. She told me the diamonds would be DEF VS and they look similar to my F color e-ring * Shape - the bracelet has the correct oval shape like the auth * Size 15 feels accurate. When I tried it in store, I tried on the small and it fit the same as the Size 15. My wrist size is 14.5 cm for reference and wear a size 16 (loose fit) for Cartier love bracelet.   **Seller Communication and Service** \- 10/10  * she's always quick to respond and doesn't get upset when i ask for additional photos or videos.

Burberry,quality,"Why are the majority of reps wayyyy oversized? After passing the overwhelming feeling like you‚Äôve struck gold when you join this sub‚Ä¶ as a typical fitting small/medium size (UK) who prefers a slim fit it‚Äôs becoming increasingly difficult to actually source high quality reps that size up ‚Äòtrue to size‚Äô.

"Nike,Adidas","waste,quality,price,haul","10 kg haul in hand review (Jordan 1's, Yeezy, Real Madrid, accesories, Nike and St√ºssy)  Agent: Pandabuy, who I'll give a strong 8/10. The one issue I had with them was when using their size helper, where the agent picks the supposedly right size for you. My agent chose the wrong size for me, while i trusted them. Will not waste time and money on that again.   Shipping Method and Price: Europe Tarifless Line-M, 887.98 CNY  Submit Date: 2023-10-31  Parcel Arrival Date: 2023-11-16  My build: I'm 189 cm / 6'3 weighing 83 kg, lean & muscular, dm for pics;)   &#x200B;  Jordan 1 Obsidian, size 46 EU:  I am by no means an expert and i don't have a retail pair to compare with, so i used Stockx and google to compare. What i have noticed is that the white leather's texture is not quite right. It's difficult to explain especially since English isn't my first language, but i'd describe it as less wrinkled than it's supposed to.   Other than that, i honestly can't find real flaws, maybe the overall shape is a little off but i wouldn't know. I give it a light 8, it might've sounded like I was less satisfied, but I'm just trying to mention all flaws I see.   &#x200B;  Jordan 1 Washed Black, size 46 EU:  These are perfect!! Or so I thought until i noticed literal pen marks above the swoosh on the right shoe. These can be seen on the third pic of the Washed Blacks. They were hard to find and will most likely not get noticed, but it obviously pulls down the overall rating. The material is insane tho, its really soft (maybe too soft??) and it looks almost identical to close up pics on google. The shape looks good to me and the colors look spot on compared to Stockx. I'm very happy with this, except for the pen marks.   I give it them a medium 8, without the pen marks i'd give them a strong 9.   &#x200B;  Yeezy Hoodie, size XXL:  I had high expectations from the reviews, and it delivered! It's heavy, soft and thick. There are no flaws from the outside. The neck tag is on point. The one flaw i noticed is that the inside washing tag doesn't exist..? But i really dont mind, they annoy me anyways. To me this hoodie is a true 10/10, but a more objective rating if that exists would be neutral 9/10.   &#x200B;  Stussy knit, size XL:  I actually thought this was a fantasy piece until i googled it for this review. Comparing to the pics i can find, the color of the ""S"" is more milky/yellowish on the rep and the overall shape of the ""S"" is wrong. Comparing it to retail this is probably only a light 3, but i love it, it feels great and it's pretty heavy. I give it a strong 7/10.   &#x200B;  Nike hoodie, size XL:  This hoodie is small on the sleeves for me, but it looks good. If i could fit it it would be a 10, i don't see anything wrong with it.   &#x200B;  Nike sweatpants, size XL:  Wearing these as i write. They fit me perfectly, are a little baggy (which i wanted) but it'll probably shrink when washed. The swoosh might be a TINY bit off-shape, but it really is nothing. They get a light 9.   &#x200B;  Real Madrid 23/24 Jerseys Player Edition, size XXL:  I have the home kit retail, also player version. The retail i have in size L, and its the same size as the XXL reps. I fit both perfectly. The material on the rep is NOWHERE near the quality of the retail. It's not very breathable and i definitely won't be doing sports in them. The ""Real Madrid"" print on the neck of the blue/grey jersey feels and looks like it'll fall off fast. Everything else LOOKS (doesn't feel) very accurate.  Compared to retail this is a 2, but if you just want something that looks good, this will be a strong 7.   &#x200B;  Real Madrid 12/13 Jersey, size XL:   Feels great and looks surprisingly accurate! The only flaw i see is the Adidas logo on the chest which looks fragile. It deserves a strong 8.   &#x200B;  Real Madrid 23/24 shorts, size XXL:  For this i used the size helper which i shouldn't have. They are too big for me. They look good though, I dont see flaws on them. If i had the right size this would be a strong 9/10.   &#x200B;  Sunglasses, onesize:  Amazing, i have no critique. Perfect 10/10.   &#x200B;  Sneaker shields:   Haven't tried them yet, but they will probably be uncomfortable. You get what you pay for and they're very cheap. 10/10.   &#x200B;  WILL THIS BE AN AMAZING REVIEW? I hope so, I spent a lot of time on this. Feel free to ask me about anything related to the haul.","{upvote:118,upvoteRatio:0.98,timestamp:2023-11-18}",Reddit,1,1

If you want to buy expensive clothes, and money is not an issue, you can buy Gucci, Prada, and D&G, including custom designs that were built to suit your own style. However, if you only want to use it as a daily wear , there are options like H&M, Zara, and Converse and within these brands, many different clothes exist. The market is huge and diverse.  This is the same for perfume. The hobby can be really expensive if you want to spend a lot and buy Niche (Like the Louis Vuitton of Fragrances, and other brands) or alternatively, you can buy New Balance fragrances. Will they both work? Yes. Will the cheaper one last as long? It can! Some customers report that some of our fragrances last even longer than the original.  Clone houses work to bridge the gap between the really high-end fragrances by using less expensive readily available ingredients in their formulations. The untrained will be unable to tell the difference, but a person who is crazy laser-focused can notice a slight difference.  ## Why Does Everyone Talk About Tom Ford Fragrances?  **‚ÄúTom Ford fragrances are just a perfect example of a decent product with absolutely AMAZING marketing... Kinda like Apple products‚Ä¶‚Äù** \- Curtis Harris, 2022 (Fragrance Room by Chez Pierre Telegram)  Just like many things in the world of Luxury, **marketing is key**. Tom Ford fragrances is very good at marketing using influencers, celebrities and so on.This gets many people involved and interested in their product.  The **fragrance blends** that they have created are **very different** from the normal fragrance ‚Äòdogma‚Äô  that the current industry has established. This differentiated approach makes their fragrance special and desirable as they stick out very differently from the sea of other ‚ÄúAdventus-Like‚Äù fragrances in the world.  Ultimately, if you are interested in TF fragrances, you have most likely got hit by their marketing and then realized that their fragrances are very different from the established norm.  ## I heard that there are Harmful Substances in clone Fragrances!  **IFRA** or the **INTERNATIONAL FRAGRANCE ASSOCIATION** ([https://ifrafragrance.org/](https://ifrafragrance.org/)) publishes a list of substances in their international standards guide. Any fragrance house that has their fragrances lab tested will be able to apply for a Certificate of Conformity after paying a membership fee and the lab test fees.  [https://ifrafragrance.org/safe-use/standards-documentation](https://ifrafragrance.org/safe-use/standards-documentation) you can read more here.  The goal of these standards and certification models is for the perfume houses to not include any harmful substances inside their products. **As our perfume-oil-making partner is located in France and operates in the EU**, they are **compliant in this regard to the IFRA certifications**.  When **IFRA revises their certifications**, all the **houses that used previously unclassified as Prohibited or Restricted substances will have to reformulate their perfumes** and this is one of the main reasons why the perfumes **smell different as the years go by** and as more and more batches are made.  One country that **does not participate in IFRA is China**. Therefore, the producers of perfumes there are free to add **any and or many 'banned' ingredients** in their perfume concentrate. This is why you should only buy from trusted Chinese brands as random off-the-shelf perfumes are created with compounds that might or might not pose an issue to you and your environment.  &#x200B;  ## Reformulations and how Brands use it to Gain More Money  Usually, when a perfumer formulates the original blend, there is a certain budget that the company allocated for the research and development of the product. In most cases, the perfumer (person who makes perfumes) will attempt to maximize the budget and there will be some *very expensive* ingredients added into it. Some expensive ingredients might include oils of natural origin instead of synthetic olls and certain chemical compounds of higher purity e.g. Ambroxide.  After the perfume launches, there is a market base for it formed, i.e. there are now paying customers for the product. The company usually sends it back to the R&D lab to swap out these expensive ingredients for cheaper ones to increase the profit margins on the product. The perfume industry is not the only one that does this, this is also a common occurrence for packaged foods.  This process of ‚Äò*sending it back into the R&D lab while keeping the scent as close as possible to the original‚Äô* is called a ‚Äò**reformulation**‚Äô... whereby the perfume is re-formulated with new compounds and is no longer the ‚Äòsame recipe‚Äô when compared to the previous batches.  Companies mainly do this for profits or to comply with an updated IFRA standard as the reformulation itself also costs money to research.  Another contributing factor that reformulations might happen is because the perfume house was sold to a larger Private Equity Firm (E.g. BlackRock Private Equity bought CREED) or a Large Cosmetic Producer Company (E.g. LVMH Group, Estee Lauder, etc) usually when that happens, the owners of the company jettison out with tads of money and the ‚Äòelite management‚Äô takes over with the sole purpose of maximizing profits which will then lead to a reformulation campaign to get more $$.  &#x200B;  # 2: Fragrance Application and Layering  ## Tips for Dry Skin  As you age, your skin becomes naturally drier in condition because your skin retains less collagen.  For people with dry skin. **It is recommended that you ‚Äòseal‚Äô your skin with an unscented moisturizer or Vaseline so that the perfume sticks better to your skin.** This is because the perfume does not last very long on dry skin and therefore the smell will not last.  When we say ‚Äú**perfume sticking to your skin**‚Äù it is about creating an ideal environment for the perfume oil to stay on your skin for a long time. The perfume oil is the one that makes the perfume‚Äôs scent, the alcohol is merely a carrier.  ## Tips for People with Eczema and Skin Issues  ## Using Moisturizers  A moisturizer, or emollient, is a cosmetic preparation used for protecting, moisturizing, and lubricating the skin. These functions are normally performed by sebum produced by healthy skin.  \- *Wikipedia*  Face cream works to moisturize the epidermis, creating a protective moisture barrier to shield skin from environmental stressors and lock in essential hydration. Knowing when and how to apply moisturizer correctly will help to keep skin hydrated and protected throughout the day.  ## How to Apply Moisturizer  A heavy-handed application can cause damage to the skin and premature aging. Applying moisturizer isn‚Äôt simply rubbing it into your skin! Follow these steps to be sure to correctly apply the moisturizer on your skin and sensitive parts:  1. Dispense the moisturizer onto the tips of your fingers, then gently rub your hands together to warm up the product and allow for an easy application. 2. Gently smooth the moisturizer over your cheeks, sweeping from the nose outwards. 3. Apply onto the forehead, working from the top of the brows towards the temples. 4. Sweep along the jawline working from the chin to the ears. 5. Use gentle circular and patting motions to absorb into the skin. 6. Apply to the neck in upward strokes, working from the decolletage to the chin. Again, do this gently to avoid pulling or tugging on the skin.  ## How much Moisturizer should I use?  Applying the right amount of moisturizer is key to maintaining healthy skin. Using too much could clog the pores and cause congestion, while using too little can leave skin feeling dry and tight. A pea-sized amount should be enough to cover the face and neck.  If the skin still feels dry consider applying a hyaluronic acid serum first.  ## When to Apply Moisturizer?  A moisturizer should be applied as part of your daily skincare routine after cleansing, toning and using serum, but before SPF and makeup. The correct order in which to apply skincare should be:  1. **Cleanser** 2. **Toner** 3. **Serum** 4. **Eye cream** 5. **Moisturizer** 6. **SPF**  ## How do I use a Face Serum with a Moisturizer?  While a good skincare routine should include both a face serum and cream, serum should always be applied before moisturizer.  A serum is designed to penetrate the skin‚Äôs surface layer and target the appearance of damage. Applying serum after moisturizer would prevent the ingredients in the serum from penetrating into the skin‚Äôs surface, as moisturizer creates a barrier over the skin. However, applying moisturizer on top of the serum helps to lock in its key ingredients.  ## What goes First? Sunscreen or Moisturizer?  Sunscreen should always be applied after moisturizer, allowing your face cream to draw moisture into the skin and the sunscreen to best protect the skin from UV damage. Applying these skincare essentials the other way would severely diminish their effectiveness.  ## Apply only Before You Leave the House, NOT after Showering  After you shower, your body temperature **tends to be quite high**. This is actually quite **bad** for perfume application, as if the heat is high, the oils will ‚Äòoxidize‚Äô faster and burn through their life cycle quickly. Therefore, because the **perfume decays the moment you spray it**, you should only aim to **spray right before you go out of your house**. This will ensure that you maximize the longevity of the perfume and not ‚Äòwaste‚Äô it as you are doing your prep work before leaving the house.  Ideally, you should seal off any dry skin with an **unscented moisturizer or Vaseline**, and leave it to sit for about **1.5 minutes before applying your Fragrance Layers**. This will ensure that your perfume has the longest longevity and enable you to stretch your dollar to its maximum with little to no resprays.  ## 2: Layering Guide for Advanced Fragrance Guys and Gals  When you have mastered your technique for spraying and are confident that you now understand which perfumes you like and the nature of the perfumes on your skin, you can embark on the brave journey of creating and layering your signature scent.  There is no end goal in this process of mixing and discovery, much like cocktails, perfumes can also be mixed and layered to bring out the best of each different perfume.  A simple guide would be:  1. **Choosing a Base Scent** 2. **Adding a Freshie or an Interesting Note** 3. **Adding an Enhancer**  ## Choosing some perfumes for Step 1: Base Scent  Some good base layers are:  1. Replica: Jazz Club / Chez Name: ***Smooth Jazz*** (Sharp Whiskey, Strong Tobacco) 2. Prada L'Homme / Chez Name: ***Holiday*** (Powdery and Iris, Strong projection) 3. Ombre Leather / Chez Name: ***Existation*** (Tobacco‚Äî Strong, Leather) 4. Armani Code / Chez Name: ***Victory*** (Light Tobacco, Semi Strong Vanilla)  ## Choosing some perfumes for Step 2: Freshie or Interesting Note  Some good top layers are:  1. Explorer / Chez Name: ***Traveller*** (Basically Aventus but More Citrusy) 2. Aqua Di Gio / Chez Name: ***Aquaman*** (Light woods, Aqua and Citrus) 3. L'immensite / Chez Name: ***Serenity*** (Grapefruit and Sweet) 4. Baccarat Rouge 540 / Chez Name: ***Bakar*** (Amber and Sweet Saffron)  ## Choosing some perfumes for Step 3: Enhancers  Some good enhancing layers are:  1. ISO-E Super / Molecule 01 / Chez Name: ***Galaxy*** (More Sillage) 2. Ambroxan / Molecule 02 / Chez Name: **TBA**  &#x200B;  ## Some Good Layer Recipes are:  **All 1:2 Unless stated otherwise. If you want to** **layer**\*\*, please use all the same concentrations.\*\*  ## PERFECT FOR WINTER: Cool Winter in a Cigar Room  **\[ BASE \] + \[ INTERESTING NOTE \] + \[ ENHANCER \]**  * **Base** \- 2x SPRAYS Ombre Leather / Chez Name: ***Existation*** (Tobacco‚Äî Strong, Leather) * **Top**   \- 4x SPRAYS L'immensite / Chez Name: ***Serenity*** (Grapefruit and Sweet) * **Enh**  \- 1x Spray Molecule 01 / Chez Name: ***Galaxy***  **Rest 20 seconds between each** **layer**\*\*.\*\*  It‚Äôs a very rich leathery tobacco fragrance but toned down with sweetness from the top note. Lasts very long because **Ombre Leather** lasts super long on the skin.  Very good winter fragrance. It will remind you of you being in a cigar room, sitting on a posh leather chair, while sipping on a bitter grapefruit + sweet lemon cocktail. The ambroxan in **L'immensite** will help in the projection of both the *base* and *top* notes.  When people hug you in the winter, they want more of it because it smells different from anything off the shelf!  ## PERFECT FOR AUTUMN: Look Ma! I Made a Cocktail!  **\[ BASE \] + \[ INTERESTING NOTE \] + \[ ENHANCER \]**  * **Base** \- 1x SPRAYS Replica: Jazz Club / Chez Name: ***Smooth Jazz*** (Sharp Whiskey, Strong tobacco) * **Top** \- 2x SPRAYS Baccarat Rouge 540 / Chez Name: ***Bakar*** (Amber and Sweet saffron) * **Enh** \- 1x SPRAY Molecule 01 / Chez Name: ***Galaxy***  **Rest 10 seconds between ‚ÄòTop‚Äô and ‚ÄòEnh‚Äô Layer.**  Holy crap, if you know what a saffron gin & tonic smells like, this smells exactly like it.  The amber and the saffron of **Baccarat Rouge 540**, cut away the spiciness of the whiskey note in **Jazz Club**. What remains is an extremely pleasant mildly alcoholic-tobacco note and an extremely nice amber and cotton candy smell. This combination elevates **Baccarat Rouge 540** to the next level.  Perfect for autumn.  &#x200B;  ## PERFECT FOR SPRING: Open Field with Grass and Flowers  **\[ BASE \] + \[ INTERESTING NOTE \] + \[ ENHANCER \]**  * **Base** \- 4x SPRAYS Chloe Eau de Parfum / Chez Name: ***Flower Dream*** (Sweet, Flowery, Fragrant, Lady Like) * **Top** \- 2x SPRAYS Green Irish Tweed / Chez Name: ***Irishman Power*** (Ozonic, Green, Grassy, Bitter) * **Enh** \- 1x SPRAY Molecule 01 / Chez Name: ***Galaxy***  **Rest 10 seconds between ‚ÄòTop‚Äô and ‚ÄòEnh‚Äô Layer.**  What do you imagine you will smell when you see an entire field of grass and white florals, with the wind blowing through the entire field, bringing that scent towards you?  Creed‚Äôs **Green Irish Tweed (Chez Name: Irishman Power)** is a very green fragrance and it really smells like a grass field with an ozonic bitterish smell in the base notes. Many people call it the ‚Äúold rich man‚Äôs scent‚Äù and it is a very ‚ÄòGreen‚Äô fragrance.  Using **Green Irish Tweed (Chez Name: Irishman Power)** on its own when you are in your 20s or 30s might be too much, and makes you smell too mature. However, pairing it with a ladies' white flora perfume, it creates a very complex, more youthful fragrance and is extremely delightful smelling with the florals lingering in the background - perfect for spring or early summer!  **\*I find that this is better if you rub the 2 layers of oils into a single layer after you spray it on your skin.**  You can change up the **‚ÄòBASE‚Äô** layer with any **sweet smelling ladies‚Äô perfume** and the smell immediately transforms, a very interesting combination. If you want something that's not citrus based or smells like **Dior Sauvage** or **Versace Eros** go ahead and try it!  Do let us know the results in the Telegram Group!  **Some other Perfumes that are good as the base are:**  Coco Mademoiselle / Chez Name: ***Madam Feather***  Gabrielle / Chez Name: ***Flower Box***  &#x200B;  ## ALL SEASONS: CHERRY & LEATHER // Contributed by Curtis Harris - our telegram member  **\[ BASE \] + \[ INTERESTING NOTE \] + \[ ENHANCER \]**  * **Base** \- 2x SPRAYS Tom Ford Tuscan Leather / Chez Name: ***Leathery Path*** (Sharp Primal Leather, Hints of Raspberry, Amber wood, Jasmine, and Spice) * **Top** \- 1x SPRAYS Tom Ford Lost Cherry / Chez Name: ***Fiction*** (Black Cherry Liqueur, Bitter Almond, Hints of Sandalwood, Vetiver and Cedar)  Now obviously **Tuscan Leather** is one of the jewels in Tom Ford's private blend. The top Raspberry note is absolutely gorgeous and unique for a Leather fragrance and the fact that it's not too overdone to the point where it's overwhelming is great from an olfactory perspective.  But one thing I've noticed about it is that in the dry down (maybe it's just my skin) it tends to develop into a nondescript berry mess which can at times come off as a tad artificial.  I think adding the **Lost Cherry** gives the overall fragrance journey a bit more complexity. Because of the almond and tonka bean notes in the **Lost Cherry,** the dry down has a much more creamy smell to it and I think the booziness of the **Lost Cherry** compliments the leathery smokiness of **Tuscan Leather** very well.  **Tuscan Leather** is obviously more geared toward your winter or fall seasons but by adding **Lost Cherry** I think it gives it a certain playfulness and depth which would work well in any season.  Just bear in mind though that **Tuscan Leather** is naturally overpowering, so if you choose to use this in a warmer season I would recommend going a bit lighter with the **Tuscan Leather** and heavier with the **Lost Cherry**.  And obviously, I don't think it needs to be said but this **isn't really a combination to wear to the gym or to a club**. The perfect combination for a **date** or for the **office** though.  &#x200B;  ## PERFECT FOR SUMMER: BLUE TRAVELLER 550  **\[ BASE \] + \[ INTERESTING NOTE \] (MIXING)**  * **50% Bleu de Chanel / Chez Name: Blue Chance 1:2** * **50% Mont Blanc Explorer / Chez Name: Traveller 1:2**  **\*This requires MIXING!**  The results are actually pretty amazing!  If you don‚Äôt know, **Mont Blanc Explorer** is actually a clone of Creed‚Äôs **Aventus**. Just with some notes more pronounced than the other notes.  Somehow I can't get **Traveller** to stick to my skin and because of that, it lasts for only about 3 hours. But after mixing it sticks to me for over 7 hours!  The smell base is very Blue and the Pineapple + Apple **in Traveller** (**Mont Blanc Explorer)** forms the middle and top notes. Very pleasant fragrance and I won't get burnt at the stake for wearing it.  ## Behind The Curtain (BTC) : The Restock Process  Our partner in France which we dub ***‚Äòthe factory‚Äô*** is a company that produces and develops custom fragrances based on customer requirements.  All the fragrance base oils they create are **IFRA** or **INTERNATIONAL FRAGRANCE ASSOCIATION** certified.  This company hires many perfumers (Ghost Perfumers) and they take on projects from various organizations that require fragrance oils. Some of these organizations that you might never think of are private banks, shopping malls, and hotels as they use these oils in their air conditioning duct systems so as to project a certain scent as you walk through the door. Other companies are those that produce cosmetics, soaps, air freshener aerosol sprays, and even laundry detergents!  Because the oil base we use which forms the scent is **IFRA certified**, our perfumes that use this oil base contain **only IFRA-certified ingredients**.  We order their minimum order quantity (MOQ) of base perfume oils from ***‚Äòthe factory‚Äô*** and after they are prepared in **France**, they will be shipped to us in **Serbia** in large industrial-sized containers.  After inspecting the quality of the batch and physically inspecting all the oils, we use our special formula to make the final product and **leave it to mature in special conditions**. Every scent has a different maturation time and that is why we say that you **do not need to maturate our perfumes if you think the scent is to your liking.**  When the fragrance are maturated, we update the website in order to take in orders again. The final products you order have **their ingredient bases from France and are handmade and bottled with love by us in Serbia**.  ## Behind The Curtain (BTC) :  How do we Come up with Ideas for New Perfumes?  ## How New Fragrances are Conceptualized  We have a few ways to decide which Fragrances we want to add to our list next.  The **first method** is from **our Community** \- **YOU GUYS!**  One of our fabulous members (**Credit: TerpeneFarmer**) came up with a very productive way to do it:  [https://poll.ly/3swUnaah8Ep9L6OH5IZv](https://poll.ly/3swUnaah8Ep9L6OH5IZv)  ## How New Fragrances are Created  After we have conceptualized the Fragrance/s, we will create a development project with our **partner in France**. In a few weeks or a few months after the project is created, they will provide us with a **small batch sample** which we mix in **our Lab in Serbia**.  Our **internal development team** will check the **quality** and **come up with the ratio needed to make the final product.** The final prototype products are **firstly given out to our internal staff members** and then are either given out in **our current orders** or to **customers that have ordered with us before**. After letting them **exist with their users** for about **a month** so that they can use it, we will gather **feedback** and **continue the development of the final-final product**.  # Outro  That is it for this part of the guide hope you liked the read and shoutout to our telegram members that helped me to write this guide!

After I had all my products in the warehouse I shipped it and it arrived in only 10 days with EMS to Barcelona, Spain.                        Review: The T-shirt is good quality as my other things from Lyfactory. The model is a Slim fit but it‚Äôs more loose then for example my Givenchy T-shirt. The Dior hoodie is definitely my favourite hoodie I ever had and saw! I‚Äôm blown away by the quality and details of it and it‚Äôs nice warm and really comfy.

[[Hello Watch V1 Review + Getting started with iWatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/11h1ywn/detailed_review_apple_watch_ultra_replica_hello/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)]  [[Hello Watch V2 Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/11pqq6u/us_nonpaid_detailed_review_apple_watch_ultra/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)]   ____________________________________________________________________________   W2C Link:  [[HK8 Pro Max Ultra](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mtN0yfg)]  Price: $45 + Free Shipping | $40 after coupon  Supports: IOS (iPhone) and Android  ____________________________________________________________________________  **Overview**:  The HK8 Pro Max Ultra is designed to compete with the long standing market champion of Apple Watch Ultra replicas, the Hello Watch line. To do this, the HK8 had to innovate in areas that the Hello watch has yet to implement. Including a 2.12‚Äù OLED screen, a new high performance dual core processor, new menu styles, and an upgraded operating system with a brand new feel, this watch could be the upset to the iWatch replica hierarchy.   *Shipment* - Seller was fast with shipment, my order went out on the same day it was purchased. Arrived to the US domestically after 4 days, and went from Orlando FL to Atlanta GA in another 4. Big props to this seller for fast shipment, 10/10.  *Arrival/Unboxing* - Came securely wrapped in a bubble mailer. No complaints on the security of packaging. Box arrived in perfect condition with no cosmetic damage. Unfortunately, unlike that of the Hello Watch V2, the box doesn‚Äôt have that wonderful Apple gravity slide. A nice packaging experience is a hallmark of this watch though, including a manual, charging cable, the watch itself, and the technicolor orange colorway ocean straps. I have no clue why I chose this color, it looks goofy as hell.  *App* - The HK8 utilizes the Wearfit Pro application. I cannot fathom why the developers would choose this app as their companion app. It‚Äôs filled with bloatware, packed to the brim with ads (some even unskippable), and has a fair amount of features locked behind paywalls.The UI is just alright, the one good thing I could say about this app is that it seems to have a lot more features available than the QiFit application. Some of these (all free) features include:  * Fitness ring completions on calendar with average number of steps per day, hours of activity, medium-high intensity movement minutes * Sleep on an intuitive graph viewable by day, week, month, and year + calendar including sleep ratio, sleep percentage (comparison to other users), and breakdowns of the sleep ratio into total, deep, light, and awake values.  Sports/Workout records * Heart Rate on a graph + calendar with readouts for average, high, and low heart rate occurrences. * Weight loggings, uses manual inputs, allows for setting weight targets and tracks kCal burns. * Stress tracking * Respiratory Rate * Glucose * Menstrual Cycle * Blood Oxygen Level * Blood pressure * Quick menu to see all this data on a single page * Dial store for watch faces * Watch notification management * Standing Reminders * Small app store * Firmware upgrades * Battery readout of watch in-app  ____________________________________________________________________________  **The Watch** - [[Photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/mglt8A9)]  *Battery* - Out of the box came at 75% charge. Using the charging cable included in the box, I took it to 100% in under 30 minutes. The watch definitely did get some heat going when it was charging, but overall to be expected, and nothing I was concerned about. It‚Äôs now been 7 days since delivery, and my battery is sitting at 21%. I would characterize my battery usage as moderate, utilizing the always on display for about a day, and playing around with a lot of the functions for the first couple days after usage. At first I figured I would see a lot more battery drain in a shorter amount of time due to the increased performance from the new chipset pushing a much higher refresh rate to the screen, but I‚Äôve resolved that much of the battery drain I expected was negated by the new AMOLED display saving on some battery life, and also that the screen wasn‚Äôt consuming nearly as much power as I anticipated. I expect about 2 more days of battery life out of the display, and could probably gain another day or two by turning off the always on display and turning off the raise to wake (which turns on the screen every time I flick my wrist). Overall I would characterize battery life as worse than the Hello V1 and V2, but only by a day or so. All in all, you‚Äôll never have to worry about this watch being dead on your wrist, and 7-8 days with most functions enabled is more than enough for me.  *Case* - The case is a titanium alloy, very similar in structure to the Hello line. However, the case is finished differently from the retail and the Hello line, I would characterize the case as appearing to have an almost greasy texture, it just seems‚Ä¶overly polished I guess? Feeling it though, I don‚Äôt really detect a difference between the Hello line and this. Not a big deal, just something I noticed. The holes cut for the speaker don‚Äôt line up perfectly with retail Ultra cases, doesn‚Äôt matter but still something to note. The side button below the digital crown doesn‚Äôt have the same polishing as the rest of the case unlike the Hello and retail Ultra watches. The digital crown spins freely without clicking as expected, but the click of both the digital crown and other buttons are higher in pitch than that of retail and the Hello line. As of thus far, it has been tough to scratch, ding, dent, or blemish the case in any way, and the overall build quality seems solid enough. Screen - This screen is about the same size as the Hello Watch V1 and is fairly comparable to the retail Ultra. The resolution is good and the color vibrancy is great. The display is incredibly bright, and looks great in high light and low light conditions due to the AMOLED display panel. It is easily the best display that I‚Äôve ever seen on an Ultra rep, hands down.  *Internals* - The chipset inside of the HK8 is again the best that I‚Äôve ever seen in an Ultra rep, hands down. The inclusion of a high octane chipset makes for a BUTTERY SMOOTH UI experience. Anyone following these posts knows that one of the main problems with Ultra reps are the low refresh rates, but this watch almost never hesitates. Stress testing this watch reveals a very competent chipset with the power to function at nearly identical speeds to the original Ultra. Very impressive, well done. Also includes a standard 450 mAh battery, 1.4mb of running memory, and a NFC chip. Additionally, there are a slew of useful sensors included for accurate and timely health readouts including:  1.) Heart Rate - Great functioning. More accurate than I‚Äôve seen on any other watch. 10/10.  2.) Compass - Fantastic functioning, again more accurate than any other watch. Sometimes requires a quick and painless calibration every once in a while. 9/10.  3.) Blood pressure - Works as expected. 10/10.  4.) Blood oxygen - Works as expected. 10/10.  5.) Proximity sensor - I think this is possibly, but improbably a fake sensor. Watch claims I need to put it on my wrist to read heart rate, but after exposing it to air for a long period of time it proceeds to read my heart rate anyways. While some say this is because the sensor is fake, the fact that my heart rate reads automatically when the watch is on my wrist tells me that the developers programmed the sensor to ignore negative proximity readouts after a certain amount of time to prevent false positives.  6.) Gyroscope - Once more, more accurate than any other rep I‚Äôve seen, step tracking was on point, exercise detection was on point, kCal burn counts are right on point, distance walked is on point. Perfect. 10/10.  *Software/UI* - Hands down, the most accurate software I‚Äôve seen to date. As compared to the Hello line, the HK8 is able to do more on its chipset in a faster and smoother way. One example of this are animations. Widgets, compass watch faces, small UI elements like the arrow for the widget menu, settings menu scrolling, the sports interfacing, the grid app list movements, from top to bottom everything is animated with Apple accurate animations, and my oh my is it ever beautiful. Menus are more accurate, such as the activity/fitness rings, icons are 1:1 with Apple, watch faces have clickable shortcuts, and the notifications‚Ä¶oh man the notifications. Notifications are unlike any Ultra replica thus far, stacking and sorting notifs from different applications into stacks, making the notification menu easier to navigate, and notifications that come through to the watch include the app icon and text on a clear bubble background that dismiss automatically after a second or two. This is by far the best notification implementation I‚Äôve seen on an Ultra rep. There are, however, still some things I would change. Some bits of text aren‚Äôt capitalized correctly within settings, and blurry animated watch faces are no fun, but other than that the software is fairly comparable to the Ultra.  ____________________________________________________________________________  **Summary** - On paper, this watch seems like the #1 Ultra replica. On the wrist, a different story is told. The biggest problem with this watch is the app. The ads and bloat make it difficult to use, and are a big turn off. Secondly, the only option to tell time is in the 24 hour format. Seriously? It would take no less than an hour to add a 12 hour format. This highlights the amount of after sales support that the developers have for this watch, that such an easy and useful feature has yet to be implemented in the many weeks since this watches release. There are other small things in the UI, like a massive system lag when clicking the ‚Äúclear all‚Äù button in notifications, no ‚Äúclear all‚Äù button in recent apps screen, no editing of apps or quick menu widgets, a lack of Ultra similar watch faces, and the screen not turning on for notifications. Hardware wise, the holes don‚Äôt line up properly with retail Ultra cases, buttons don‚Äôt feel as premium as the Hello line, the vibration motor is too weak, the display doesn‚Äôt dim far enough, and oddly enough the biggest no-no for me: The display doesn‚Äôt turn off when covering the screen (palm gesture). I never realized just how much I use the palm gesture on the Hello, and having to wait 3 seconds for the screen to turn off in the middle of the night when the display is so bright is pure hell.  ____________________________________________________________________________  **Final Thoughts**: Your mileage may vary. If you prefer better sensors, a more premium screen, a superior UI and better internals the HK8 may be for you. Otherwise, I can‚Äôt recommend this watch. As of now, I‚Äôve yet to see interest from developers in supporting this watch with continued system updates, and with the problems it faces currently it‚Äôs not something I can personally recommend to you guys. As of now, I still recommend the [[Hello Watch V2](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805166558702.html?spm=a2g0o.store_pc_allProduct.8148356.13.395b4134hKuE20&pdp_npi=2%40dis%21USD%21US%20%24136.87%21US%20%2441.06%21%21%21%21%21%40210321c716799225691603945e501b%2112000032717736604%21sh&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa&_randl_shipto=US)].  ____________________________________________________________________________   Thanks so much for reading my review!

This one is a find from the 2022 collection, with the black on black badge. Personally I prefer 2020. Lots of discussion about ""Anton batches"" and ""the best factory's"" on the sub - personally, I don't buy into it. This jacket is nice, it does its job and has kept me warm so far. The pockets are spacious and its pretty accurate on the surface to the naked eye.

Note the bag is nylon / flimsy, not firm, so if not full the shape can kinda flop. Im a big fan of it thought overall and recommend it if you're looking for a clean one. Straps are a nice detail.

Its warm, but has a story of shanghai tag - no Burberry branding and some bleeding of the black. It does feel nice but out of the 3 things it needs its only 1.

Original link is dead but i see it pop up between 170-220Y quite often. This shit is like 0.99:1 , i cant spot a flaw. It's come in handy, has a built in cardholder, and overall just is a functional bag with a nice design.

"Nike,LV,Adidas,YSL","quality,price,haul","[Review] Saint Laurent, Celine, Undercover, Rick Owens, Margiela GATs, Korean, silver accessories. ~7 kg, tons of fit pics # PHOTO ALBUMS FIRST!  **[[ALL ITEMS]](https://imgur.com/a/A7xkNMk)**   **[[MINI LOOKBOOK]](https://imgur.com/a/fgWA5cX)**   ## Intro  Enjoy my first review! I worked hard to make this haul informative, well-formatted, and easy to digest with lots of pictures. Each item has a photo album including hanger pics, on-body pics, detail shots, and outfit pics. The format is based on the /r/RepLadies template so I give ratings for Quality, Accuracy, and my Satisfaction for each item.  Most of these items were found through reddit. I kept track of most sources and included ""further reading"" links to old posts if you want to find out more.  Disclosure: this review isn't sponsored in any way and I paid for everything myself.  ## Agent/ Shipping Info  Used Wegobuy. Shipped to Canada with GD-EMS. Did a split haul (2 packages) with my gf so I can't break it down perfectly. Both declared at $14 USD and customs was cleared within minutes for both.  * Package 1: 3.3 kg, 470 Y (~92 CAD). Shipped Sep 18, received Sep 23. * Package 2: 9.3 kg, 1070 Y (~211 CAD). Shipped Sep 18, received Oct 2 (was stuck in China for weeks smh)  I wanted to keep some packaging (shoeboxes) but not others, so I did not check the ""remove all packaging options"" and instead left instructions for WGB on which packaging to keep. They followed instructions on Package 1 but not Package 2, which added a lot of weight :(  DM if you're curious about her items.  ## Stats  Height: 6'0 (182cm)  Weight: 147 lb (67 kg)  Shoulders: 44-ish cm (17-ish inches)  Chest (all around): 91-ish cm (36-ish inches)   Shoe Size: 8-8.5 US, 41 EU.

"Nike,Adidas","waste,quality,price,haul","10 kg haul in hand review (Jordan 1's, Yeezy, Real Madrid, accesories, Nike and St√ºssy)  Agent: Pandabuy, who I'll give a strong 8/10. The one issue I had with them was when using their size helper, where the agent picks the supposedly right size for you. My agent chose the wrong size for me, while i trusted them. Will not waste time and money on that again.   Shipping Method and Price: Europe Tarifless Line-M, 887.98 CNY  Submit Date: 2023-10-31  Parcel Arrival Date: 2023-11-16  My build: I'm 189 cm / 6'3 weighing 83 kg, lean & muscular, dm for pics;)   &#x200B;  Jordan 1 Obsidian, size 46 EU:  I am by no means an expert and i don't have a retail pair to compare with, so i used Stockx and google to compare. What i have noticed is that the white leather's texture is not quite right. It's difficult to explain especially since English isn't my first language, but i'd describe it as less wrinkled than it's supposed to.   Other than that, i honestly can't find real flaws, maybe the overall shape is a little off but i wouldn't know. I give it a light 8, it might've sounded like I was less satisfied, but I'm just trying to mention all flaws I see.   &#x200B;  Jordan 1 Washed Black, size 46 EU:  These are perfect!! Or so I thought until i noticed literal pen marks above the swoosh on the right shoe. These can be seen on the third pic of the Washed Blacks. They were hard to find and will most likely not get noticed, but it obviously pulls down the overall rating. The material is insane tho, its really soft (maybe too soft??) and it looks almost identical to close up pics on google. The shape looks good to me and the colors look spot on compared to Stockx. I'm very happy with this, except for the pen marks.   I give it them a medium 8, without the pen marks i'd give them a strong 9.   &#x200B;  Yeezy Hoodie, size XXL:  I had high expectations from the reviews, and it delivered! It's heavy, soft and thick. There are no flaws from the outside. The neck tag is on point. The one flaw i noticed is that the inside washing tag doesn't exist..? But i really dont mind, they annoy me anyways. To me this hoodie is a true 10/10, but a more objective rating if that exists would be neutral 9/10.   &#x200B;  Stussy knit, size XL:  I actually thought this was a fantasy piece until i googled it for this review. Comparing to the pics i can find, the color of the ""S"" is more milky/yellowish on the rep and the overall shape of the ""S"" is wrong. Comparing it to retail this is probably only a light 3, but i love it, it feels great and it's pretty heavy. I give it a strong 7/10.   &#x200B;  Nike hoodie, size XL:  This hoodie is small on the sleeves for me, but it looks good. If i could fit it it would be a 10, i don't see anything wrong with it.   &#x200B;  Nike sweatpants, size XL:  Wearing these as i write. They fit me perfectly, are a little baggy (which i wanted) but it'll probably shrink when washed. The swoosh might be a TINY bit off-shape, but it really is nothing. They get a light 9.   &#x200B;  Real Madrid 23/24 Jerseys Player Edition, size XXL:  I have the home kit retail, also player version. The retail i have in size L, and its the same size as the XXL reps. I fit both perfectly. The material on the rep is NOWHERE near the quality of the retail. It's not very breathable and i definitely won't be doing sports in them. The ""Real Madrid"" print on the neck of the blue/grey jersey feels and looks like it'll fall off fast. Everything else LOOKS (doesn't feel) very accurate.  Compared to retail this is a 2, but if you just want something that looks good, this will be a strong 7.   &#x200B;  Real Madrid 12/13 Jersey, size XL:   Feels great and looks surprisingly accurate! The only flaw i see is the Adidas logo on the chest which looks fragile. It deserves a strong 8.   &#x200B;  Real Madrid 23/24 shorts, size XXL:  For this i used the size helper which i shouldn't have. They are too big for me. They look good though, I dont see flaws on them. If i had the right size this would be a strong 9/10.   &#x200B;  Sunglasses, onesize:  Amazing, i have no critique. Perfect 10/10.   &#x200B;  Sneaker shields:   Haven't tried them yet, but they will probably be uncomfortable. You get what you pay for and they're very cheap. 10/10.   &#x200B;  WILL THIS BE AN AMAZING REVIEW? I hope so, I spent a lot of time on this.

There was only one shipping option from China Direct to DR, and they wanted around $50 more than if I shipped to US  Package was submitted on 09-15 Received in US 10-04 (19 days)  Got charged an extra $15 from US to DR. (2 days)  [How the package arrived](https://imgur.com/a/qNmPDLv)  &#x200B;  \- - - C O N T E N T S - - -  All items were ordered from [Husky](https://husky-reps.x.yupoo.com/), I thought they were going to arrive together as I was checked out all items together from one seller but there were 4 separate orders in WegoBuy.  \-------------------------------------------------------------  **Lacoste Navy Blue Polo** \- [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=645859390038) || [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/p33sqsb) \-  Size: M  Price: Ôø•98  Opinion:  Looks good overall, the material is not the best and tag crocodile looks a little wonky.  Score: 7/10  \-------------------------------------------------------------  **Lacoste Navy Shirt** \- [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=646498845160) || [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/SH0X8Gm) \-  Size: L  Price: Ôø•95  Opinion:  Fits baggie, I should have ordered M. Material is very good and looks like it's going to last a while. I think the croc is too big on the front.  Score: 8/10  \-------------------------------------------------------------  **Ralph Lauren Wine Red Polo** \- [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=647039534912&spm=1101.1101.N.N.6bedf89) || [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/nfLNvDs) \-  Size: M  Price: Ôø•118  Opinion:  Darker than in the pictures but that is not a problem. Is the exact same polo as the Lacoste one but with the Polo logo. While doing this review I realized the tag stitching on the back is very noticeable, which killed this for me.  Score: 5/10  \-------------------------------------------------------------  **Ralph Lauren Denim Blue Shirt** \- [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=638387978001) || [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/fSFYzvT) \-  Size: M  Price: Ôø•119  Opinion:I should have sized down to S for this one, my body doesn't fill the shirt the way I like it. Logo is bad, I don't know why I didn't ask for QC close ups for this logo, it would have been a RL. The material is very good and feels like denim.  Score: 6/10  \-------------------------------------------------------------  **KITH Simpsons Black Shirt -** [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=643355348728) || [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/0Wi4758) \-  Size: S  Price: Ôø•99  Opinion:  There is always a favorite piece in all hauls and this is mine, I was stunned at how sturdy and great the material felt when I first unpacked this. Is very heavy and black is very deep. Fits big even in S, so be prepared for a baggie fit. The graphic quality is nice and all tags look good. Will purchase more KITH reps for sure.  Score: 11/10  \-------------------------------------------------------------  **Patagonia Grey Shorts** \- [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=648469336704) || [QC](https://imgur.com/a/iLQKkva) \-  Size: 38  Price: Ôø•98  Opinion:  These are very nice shorts, material not too heavy and I would wear this a lot if they actually fitted. I don't know what happened to me that I sized up this much even when I measured. Gave them to my brother right away, that's why there are not In hand pics.  Score: 8/10  \- - - O V E R A L L  O P I N I O N - - -  I'm happy with the haul, gave me a good understanding on how things works first hand (which is what I wanted).  I've seen some strong opinions for Couture Rep pieces and after this I can actually agree with them, the cost of the item + shipping will get you very close to the price of a retail item on sites like ebay and such, where there is no need to gamble if the seller will use good material and embroidery (at least for polos).

Lululemon,"quality,thoughts","Review of more Lululemon items from Lulu Tom! Hey everyone! I ended up getting another order delivered from Lulu Tom (TS) and wanted to share. Some items are replicas of retail and others are fantasy or similar to retail. Overall the quality is really good, but some items are higher quality than others. The text on the Lululemon cardboard tags all appear to be similar except for the sizing, which is accurate.  **Disclaimer**  I bought two of these items (Align Shorts & mens joggers), but the rest were sent as free gifts to share about here. Also, Lulu Tom (TS) does not use agents and ships direct. Find his contact info in the Trusted Sellers list: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/wiki/trusted#wiki\_lululemon](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/wiki/trusted#wiki_lululemon)  **Images (mine)**  [https://imgur.com/a/5jNIM7C](https://imgur.com/a/5jNIM7C)  **Items**  Each of the items below are reviewed in order as they appear in the Imgur album above.  **Swiftly Tech Long Sleeve 2.0 (Blue) ‚Äì¬†Medium**  This shirt is really soft, stretchy, and breathable. My wife really likes how it fits and said she plans on using it when she goes for a jog. Inside the sleeve there is a little strap of material you can put your thumb through to keep the sleeves down while being active.  **Workout shirt with mesh back (Pink) ‚Äì Large**  This one didn‚Äôt end up fitting my wife as she had hoped, but she had some thoughts on it. It feels sort of like the kind of shirt you‚Äôd wear when surfing. It‚Äôs soft and comfortable but was too short. She said it would be good for a dance class or something where you want a bit more room to breathe in your midsection.  **Sports bra with built-in mesh shirt (Black) - Large**  This one is really well-made and very comfortable. It is a sports bra but has a sort of mesh mini shirt attached to it. The material is really soft and high quality. The stitching is great especially on the mesh, which is impressive.  **Mens joggers with zipper pockets (Black) - Large: $26**  These joggers are really soft and lightweight. They‚Äôre super comfortable and I could spend all day in them. They have zipper pockets on the front which I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of at first, but I don‚Äôt think it will bother me too much.  **Align High-Rise Shorts (Black Camo) ‚Äì Size 8: $20**  These shorts were ordered for my sister and they are made from a super soft, extremely stretchy material. The material feels just like the Align leggings I ordered last time, but with more stretch to them and a bit thinner. Still just as comfy though. The camo print looks awesome, in my opinion, and I think she will definitely like these.  **Mens workout shirt (Gray Camo/Paint)**  This shirt didn‚Äôt end up fitting me very well. While the materials is light, soft, and breathable it doesn‚Äôt feel very high quality and seems that it might break down faster than the other items. I really like how it looks, but it just didn‚Äôt end up fitting me well in the right places.  **Mens shorts similar to Pace Breaker Linerless Shorts (Black)**  These shorts are awesome. They‚Äôre really comfy and soft and have zipper pockets, which I like more on these shorts since they‚Äôre sort of hidden away by the flaps of fabric in front of them. They go down to just above the knee on me and I am 6‚Äô (182 cm) tall.  Overall, really happy with these items and I plan on finding some people who can use the items that didn‚Äôt end up fitting me. üòÅ;;Do he have wechat??","{upvote:1,timestamp:2022-06-05}",Reddit,0,

"Nike,Dior,Ralph Lauren,Tommy Hilfiger","waste,quality,price,haul","My Past Haul 2021-2022 Part 1  STATS:  * Height: 182cm * Weight: 85kg * Body type: skinny fat * Bank account: Empty  SHIPPING:  * I've done multiple shipments using a blacklisted agent to Hungary. * 5785g / 39780cm¬≥ with DPD tax free to Hungary cost 883 RMB. This package was vacuum packed and had a lot inside 6 sweaters, 1 t shirt, pair of trousers, 1 TNF Nupste * 1090g / 13125cm¬≥ with DHL tax free air mail to Hungary cost 332 RMB. This package only had a pair of dunks inside. In retrospect was a waste of volumetric weight but I was too impatient to get my hands on the dunks.  **Tommy Hilfiger Jeans -** 145 RMB + 6 RMB local shipping  Rating: 10/10  Size: 33""  One of my favourite go to jeans, was worried they were going to be too tight but surprisingly they fit extremely well - perfect length and sit on the waist perfectly. Material is great and does not feel cheap at all. No idea if there is a retail version like this but I am not bothered about it all.  QC/In-Hand Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/v3NiphA](https://imgur.com/a/v3NiphA)  W2C: from RepCourier but the link is dead now  **Dickies 872 Trousers -** 69 RMB  Rating: 10/10  Size: 33""  For the price these are an absolute steal, I got the 33 inch waist grey version of these and again fit me perfectly on the waist and in length. Materials again feel very good, trousers are still a bit stiff but I definitely need to break them in more.  QC/In-Hand Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/rdM2fIT](https://imgur.com/a/rdM2fIT)  W2C: [https://shop1303790680.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4440866443](https://shop1303790680.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4440866443)  **Nike Panda Dunks M Batch -** 340 RMB  Rating: 9/10  Size: EU 44.5  I think these are an absolute steal. I'm not the best QCer but I think these are pretty damn good. The stitched nike logo on the bag has a loose thread. Apart from that I've worn them a lot for the last month and they're also very comfy.  QC/In-Hand Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/SusavyH](https://imgur.com/a/SusavyH)  W2C: [https://shop1386929838.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3929103371](https://shop1386929838.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3929103371)  **Vintage Christian Dior Monsieur Sweatshirt -** 155 RMB  Rating: 6.5/10  Size: XL  Was expecting better quality for this piece. It feels rather thin but then I have no idea how it is compared to retail, I'm comparing it to the Ambition Vintage Nike crewnecks I purchased. It's rather light in weight so better suited to wear when it's not so cold. The inside is still really soft but the embroidery on the front is a bit sloppy. However, I think when you're wearing it can't really tell and plus I've got nothing but compliments for this piece.  QC/In-Hand Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/l0gaPGT](https://imgur.com/a/l0gaPGT)  W2C: [https://alienstudio.x.yupoo.com/albums/102890468?uid=1](https://alienstudio.x.yupoo.com/albums/102890468?uid=1)  **Ami Sweater -** 79 RMB  Rating: 8/10  Size: XL  Got this piece in the green colour. I'm not sure what the retail piece should be like but I really like this piece too. The material inside is a terry cotton I guess, it is not soft like the ambition crewneck. It fits well on the body only note is probably that the neck is tad bit wide but it looks good when wearing a shirt underneath.

The hoodie blank is nice and heavy with a super soft inside, it has kept very warm on numerous occasions. Fits me great, not oversized or anything.

Both super soft on the inside and great materials, kept me nice and warm during the winter. The brown one I bought in XL but it was way too big for, I managed to put in the dryer and shrink it, it still fits quite big but better. The arm length is falls on my wrists but a little longer. The washed black colour fits great, shorter than the the brown one giving it a slightly cropped look which suited me quite well but the arm length is just a tad short especially when I'm making any arm movements. I reckon size L would have been the sweet spot for me.

Fit is great, just the right amount of oversized-ness for me. Material is slightly thinner than the crewneck and not as soft inside.  QC/In-Hand Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/GrZXJpH](https://imgur.com/a/GrZXJpH)  W2C: [https://ambition-official.x.yupoo.com/albums/78982132?uid=1](https://ambition-official.x.yupoo.com/albums/78982132?uid=1)  **Kith Coca Cola Crewneck Hansolo** \- 189 RMB + 5 RMB shipping  Rating: 6/10  Size: L  I copped this in a cream colourway. The inside material is also soft but not as soft as the ambition ones. Fit is slightly big, I think I should I have sized down on this because it just looks big and baggy and not nicely oversized. Embroidery seems to be fine to me but the Kith logo should be in red and not white.  QC/In-Hand Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/IPsraZa](https://imgur.com/a/IPsraZa)  W2C: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=630355651041&spm=1101.1101.N.N.24348d8](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=630355651041&spm=1101.1101.N.N.24348d8)  **Essentials Knit Hoodie -** 144 RMB + 5 RMB local shipping  Rating: 6/10  Size: L  Definitely overestimated how oversized this is. Absolutely humungous. The knit material is actually very nice and the hoodie is very heavy, it comes almost to 1.5kg. It is definitely keeping you warm during the cold. If it wasn't for how big it was I would have given it a better rating.

Wow, I was surprised how puffy it got. I was initially worried about the puffiness and the dog smell. The overall puffiness of the jacket is good however I feel like there is some down filling lacking in the arms and in the posterior-inferior pad. I have worn this in the rain a few times and have had no wet dog smell. Sizing wise, it fits great, arm length is good and overall length is good and I can easily fit sweaters and hoodies underneath.  QC/In-Hand Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/Fe1iv3C](https://imgur.com/a/Fe1iv3C)  W2C: the link I used is dead but from Husky  **Ralph Lauren Cable Knit**  Rating: 6/10  Size: XXL  Copped this in a burgundy colour, it fits very nicely to the body however it makes me look weird, idk there's something slightly off about the shape. My only other complaint is that it is quite itchy I'm guessing it is from the wool material. Definitely check the size chart if you want to purchase it.

Uniqlo,,"158sir FOG Essentials I don‚Äôt think anyone has posted a review of these yet so I might as well do one for those looking to get them.  I will be comparing it to my retail version  Main flaws -material doesn‚Äôt feel as soft as retail right out of packaging, haven‚Äôt washed it yet  -neck hole thingy (where your head comes out from) is way too big   -tags on the collar is decent enough  -inner tag is off where should be a lil space for a QR code sticker but it isn‚Äôt there  -front wording for essentials is way too glossy  -the sizing is pretty messed up too, ordered the same size as retail but retail is longer   Good stuff -its 8 dolans (i cant even get Uniqlo tees for 8 dolans at my local Uniqlo)  I would say if your local Uniqlo sells tees <= 8 dolans, its more value for money to get the Uniqlo tee, just my 2 cents.   pics: https://imgur.com/a/EUhi8me  W2C: 158sir taobao","{upvote:25,upvoteRatio:0.92,timestamp:2020-09-09}",Reddit,1,0
Nike,haul,"My step dad wants a haul now. Hey everyone my name is Donnell. I received my 4th haul on the Dec 14, as I was unboxing my haul. A hoodie (Nike x FOG) didnt fit so he walked in and said what stuff do you have this time. I told him you can have this hoodie he put it on and it fit him perfectly. He went to the store and everything with it. He came back and examined my haul he liked the Bred 4s I had and all the bags and palm angel trackpants I had. Now he wants to sit down and talk with me about making him a haul. He thought everything was like 100$ and I told him more like 15$ and now he talks to me daily about making a haul. So if I can get you guys to help on making a haul that will be amazing. This is the first time me and him are actually bonding together so am happy. He told me he wants nike tracksuits and stuff which I cant find on the searchbar and matching shoes which I have found already (The shoes). Im not asking you to search all day but if you have any links which matching pants and a jacket that‚Äôll be enough. THANKS EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR HELPING ME THROUGH EVERYTHING!!!!!

What do you wear for example for layering? Im almost daily wearer of basic/plane clothes and would like to step up my game.  I am not experienced at all most of time I am H&M slave. T shirts I mostly buy just H&M because it is easiest and probably cheapest option. Imo quality last only couple washes and it stretched out quickly so not great at all.

Same for Zara expect last time I bought there some more expensive t shirt (25‚Ç¨) opposed to basics and i was quite surprised with weight and quality even collar was thick.

It seems that this specific pair of slides is very popular in the FashionReps community. I do understand why, it's really cheap and at the end of the day just slides. Overall it's definitely okay and quite comfortable, but the sizing is quite off, and had to toss this pair in the dryer for 10 minutes first to shrink it. Aside from that, it doesn't have any major flaws and I doubt someone would call you out on slides.   7.5/10  All the items above were actually shipped together so if you're wondering how much it costs in total: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/MP8j5A3)   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Chrome Hearts Rings | Chocolate 52 and Apricot 42 | Size 8 and Size 9 | Weight: 10g & 15g| 22 yuan each**  [https:\/\/item. taobao .com\/item.htm?id=618797921388](https://preview.redd.it/ijhn79c65w291.jpg?width=3162&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7f7f06f4b5abd8364107fd0a26d0c2843de9188)  More in hand pics & agent QC pics: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/0PxceEW).  Both of them look really nice IRL. Don't have retail to compare it with but I'd say it looks pretty good regardless of accuracy. It doesn't make my finger green whatsoever and for the price, it's REALLY good. Still getting used to the size 9 ring (Apricot  42) it's pretty thick for a ring. However, I wish I bought 1 or 2 more of the smaller one, looks so clean IRL.   9.5/10   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Chrome Hearts Chain | Silver colored| Weight: 185g | 109 yuan (from BlackCat Studio)**  [https:\/\/item. taobao .com\/item.htm?id=641883941234](https://preview.redd.it/kg4jdgqe6w291.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e96fa6d5d0151b00dfefdaddadb921981aed529)  More in hand pics & agent QC pics: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/nAg1ZVK).  This one is CLEAAAN AF, for 109 yuan it's a steal. Looks sick IRL, don't know what else to say. Not sure about the accuracy but it seems most things are correct.

This one is interesting, first of all, it looks amazing for an airforce. If you want airforces but don't want to be too basic, I'd highly recommend this one. Most details are right, the quality is ok, and the price is ok, but the look of the shoe makes up for it IMO. Thing is, after buying this pair again from the same seller it looked a bit different and had some flaws and I had to request an exchange. I'll include both in the Imgur. Fits big, so size down. Normally I wear 43 and I had to pick 42 for this one (9 US -> 8.5 US)   7.9/10 ^((Would've been 8.5 if the seller stayed consistent))   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Guess T-Shirt | Green vertical stripes | Size M | Weight: 250g | 125 yuan**  [https:\/\/item. taobao .com\/item.htm?id=617611516508](https://preview.redd.it/v3v84twl8w291.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ae59d8c4c076fbd6673adae542c80f82bbef7ab)  More in hand pics & agent QC pics: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/qiccESq).  I can't even tell if this one is actually authentic because when ordering it said it was an original order but slightly flawed. Well, it had 1 flaw, if you look closely in the middle the brown stripe has a ""stain"" on it, well it may look like that, it's just a painting error. Aside from that, the t-shirt looks really nice. I mainly have plain clothes anyways so aside from the HP tees this is a nice switch. You can make a nice outfit with this t-shirt. Will have an extra picture of that in the Imgur.   8/10  All items above were also shipped together, so here is how much it costs in total: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/7z69LSB)   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Heron Preston Longsleeve | Black ( HP Crane Turtleneck Bottoming - Black ) | Size M | Weight: 380g | 139 yuan**  [https:\/\/item. taobao .com\/item.htm?id=656103824363](https://preview.redd.it/fqxyumwt9w291.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf186142deb4dc419bbd8a3847b9ec9795db9963)  More in hand pics & agent QC pics: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/ebWKRef).  I always wanted this one and this clothing piece actually got me into FashionReps. After a long search and many deadlinks, I found one, and I think it's one of the best replica out there. Yes, it does have the ""keep away erom fire"" flaw but aside from that, it's really good and aesthetically pleasing. It's quite thick for a t-shirt and the stitching is good.   9/10   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Yeezy Slide | Bone | Size 43 | Weight: 790g | 140 yuan (H12)**  [https:\/\/ weidian .com\/item.html?itemID=3660596020](https://preview.redd.it/1se546flaw291.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c27842f87e4519f797b57d77ff138137d557f7f9)  More in hand pics & agent QC pics: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/3gqnKB6).  Now, this is how it's properly done. Seems flawless so IMO 1:1. Sizing is TTS and overall really comfy. it is nearly triple the price of TJ's but if you're going to buy a cheap pair of slides why not get a 1:1 while you're at it right?   9.5/10   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Yeezy 350 V2 | Bone (Pure Oat White) | Size 38 (Gift) | Weight: 950g | 160 yuan**  [https:\/\/ weidian .com\/item.html?itemID=4509850227&spider\_token=4572](https://preview.redd.it/9y9o4679bw291.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5919bba09ee8728546d45ef124bb64ea0ac043e)  More in hand pics & agent QC pics: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/IDo8Vct).  Looks really good for the price. Has some minor flaws here and there such as the overall shape, it isn't too obvious though, and not really noticeable on foot. Lace holes are a little too wide. But overall it looks so nice IRL. Boost feels really soft like retail. Since I have a retail pair I was able to compare them side by side and to my surprise, this pair even got the small details right such as the logo on the insole bruh. It's a gift and too small for me so I couldn't really take it for a walk.   8.5/10   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Ok, the next part doesn't include really replicas unless you consider realtakai an actual brand and not a dropshipper. After browsing through their website I noticed some really nice pieces and found out they got them from a Taobao seller. I don't know why but I couldn't really take 1 solid picture but fear not, I will still include in-hand pictures in the Imgur. I'll use pics of the internet so you know what it looks like. Size up 1 for all the pieces listed down below.  **Beige flannel | Plaid | Size L | Weight: 505g | 108 yuan**  [https:\/\/item. taobao .com\/item.htm?id=633916676488](https://preview.redd.it/isop7tfeew291.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cf56f350ad1a36e1342f653cb5e10e30e81d283)  More in hand pics & agent QC pics: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/l2DjNPI).  Looks so nice IRL, especially with the right lighting, easy to style, and overall looks stylish. It has a relaxing vibe to it and fits TTS if you pick 1 size up. Normally I wear size M and got this in a size L and it fits perfectly. The material feels a bit rough on the skin at first but after a wash, it feels much better. Pretty sure because it's made out of wool.   9.5/10   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Dark brown flannel | Brown | Size L | Weight: 695g | 108 yuan**  [https:\/\/item. taobao .com\/item.htm?id=629941615417](https://preview.redd.it/tfg0e1difw291.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f09fd356b68047bf3e3246acb6875c3c71461d5)  More in hand pics & agent QC pics: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/iXKOuBQ).  Literally same opinion as the beige flannel, it's really similar just a different color.   9.5/10   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Turtleneck longsleeve | Black | Size L | Weight: 370g | 78 yuan**  [https:\/\/item. taobao .com\/item.htm?id=629000450903](https://preview.redd.it/a5o8qrkyfw291.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d454cb9382ddc2939afb673fee04b63956d9fdb)  More in hand pics & agent QC pics: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/R0s0Kv0).  Good quality, very soft and comfy. Surprisingly thick for a 78 yuan T-Shirt, especially from Taobao. Once again, size up once to get the correct size.   9.5/10   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Chain | Silver | Weight: 30g | 38.50 yuan**  [https:\/\/item. taobao .com\/item.htm?id=652974534288&spm=1101.1101.N.N.c8f55c0](https://preview.redd.it/zl7ujehqgw291.jpg?width=708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a73c1fbc17f7c177283e9eb4d2b9b0fdbbd220fc)  More in hand pics & agent QC pics: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/m5x1CqU).  Cheap jewelry, but it looks nice. Nothing much else to add.   8/10.  All items above, the flannels, turtleneck, and chain were shipped together, so here is how much it costs in total: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/tEJAdMx)   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  That was all for now. I know it isn't your usual ""hypebeast"" review with all fancy brands but for the ones looking for some lowkey/stylish pieces I hope you found something at least. And about the last part, I know I have to use my own pics but I don't have a clear picture that shows the clothing piece well. However, I still added in-hand pictures in the Imgur so I hope that's OK.   *^(Edit: fixed typos/links)*   ;;Hey Repfam!

"Nike,Gucci,Prada","quality,haul,comparison","REVIEW - 3.08 kg haul to US finally have time (and also had a chance to wear everything) to do a quick review on the items from my QC post: [VUJADE pants, Gucci rings, Potato shirt, AMI cardigan, Prada bolo tie, Nike Nocta tops, Celine hoodie, Issey Miyake pants](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/12zus9r/qc_vujade_pants_gucci_rings_potato_shirt_ami/). overall, very happy with everything in this order.  **w2c links are in the other post, click through there for these items.**  **parcel details:**  * agent: pandabuy * shipping cost: 484.03 yuan * shipping method: ZJ-EMS * shipping time: 6 days  **my specs:**  * height: 5'10"" (177.8 cm) * weight: 155 lbs (70.3 kg) * build: lean/athletic * suit jacket size: about a 38 * pant waist size: 30 * pant length: 32 * non numeric pants/shorts sizes: small * tee shirts: anything that's an oversize fit is a small, regular fit shirts will be a size medium if I want the shoulders and arms to be tighter, a large for a more comfortable and roomier fit. * random item for comparison: i own a set of genuine essentials sweats (hoodie and shorts), and both are a size small  **VUJADE pants:**  https://preview.redd.it/e2jxirk0llab1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efb5bd125ea831331f2ca94129e439599b583263  [stitching details just okay](https://preview.redd.it/39v151o0llab1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0165eaf90563e22687d44b2f0f5daf3938183a47)  * size: Medium * 9/10 * i have no idea how these compare to retail, but the material is a heavier weight and stitching details are solid. for those of you wondering, no, the flare on these pants don't really make my butt look too big. if this is a concern, i'd recommend getting them in black as it will create a more slimming look. size medium was just right for my build as my quads are bigger from the sports i play right now, but only just so. the length was also perfect, but they lose a point for the drawstring because it just feels like a weird elastic material choice. not sure what the genuine ones are like, though.  **gucci rings:**  https://preview.redd.it/kpefqii0llab1.jpg?width=1269&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9fe473bbeb0b2f88ea949e6363f34668e0f1bbef  * size: various, but all TTS. make sure you look at their sizing guide and choose your ring size accordingly (if you don't own something to measure your ring size, pick one up) * 8.5/10 * all lead tested and were lead free. my only complaint is that the black parts of the rings dont seem as recessed and visible as the real deal, but no one is going to call you out on this.  **potato market only fans shirt:**  https://preview.redd.it/1ryif5k0llab1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14773ed7f518cc4ba0070c895727720bd3d6669f  * size: Medium * 10/10 * actually a bit of an oversize fit, so it is not as tight on my body as expected, but i actually really like the fit i ended up with. graphic print is great and it's a heavy weight cotton, so it feels like a quality shirt. i get a lot of lol'z for this.  **ami cardigan:**  https://preview.redd.it/2nrzxel0llab1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90d5714d5e7272982d1aeb71f3d8b151c83ebd12  [stitching details, sorry it's a bit over-exposed](https://preview.redd.it/49belhj0llab1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=709d94022030c998b91241d72fa5246cadd66c60)  * size: Small * 9/10 * great fabric weight and the heart logo was not weird in any way. oversize fit and TTS. my only issue is that the fabric color seems a tiny bit faded, and while i haven't compared to retail, i would imagine ami would had a darker navy than this one. still a great cop.  **prada bolo tie:**  https://preview.redd.it/84jn3sl0llab1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c890a9bb05f7ba1a549ba34c2dc50d9ca25cb5d  * size: OSFA * 9.5/10 * not much to say here, looks great and pretty accurate. the only reason this is getting a 9.5 is because i cant, for the life of me, straighten out the tie entirely as it was packed pretty tightly. this might just need time or warmth to soften the material a bit.  **NOCTA golf mock neck sweater:**  https://preview.redd.it/f1lrvdk0llab1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73b86783930f0f1895c236d23d13816e2913b6d4  [LOVED the rubber nike logo

other items i own from nike in a size small and the details are all on point.  **NOCTA golf mock neck shirt:**  https://preview.redd.it/545b8hi0llab1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f9f8e3daffc55e9747269cc8070a7893a53438f  [printed logos, even has the small arrow

have is that the neck doesnt fit as tightly as the sweater does, but i've tried on the tiger woods mock neck shirts and i think this is just how they all fit - that or i need to do more shrugs to get yoked out (it's probably this).  **celine hoodie:**  https://preview.redd.it/qb02bwj0llab1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b47f9a66db5da80f1de2cf379bfe6e7f741f68b5  &#x200B;  [nice

nearly 1:1 retail, it even has the celine labeled metal tips on the hood draw string. im giving it a 9.5 only because i haven't had a chance to get into a celine store yet to check the quality of the print and the hood depth on the real thing yet. don't get me wrong, the print and hood depth are good on the rep, but i'd want to confirm. i'm positive that no one will be able to tell the difference in passing.  **issey miyake pants:**  [note: i added an extra long shoelace as a belt, that doesn't come with the pants.](https://preview.redd.it/3yngxaj0llab1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5e96da1196053a404b5a782f7362cf231194bdb)  * size: Medium * 8.5/10 * overall, these are pretty good. the pleats are interesting, the cut is great, and they're damn comfortable to wear. i was hoping for a slightly longer pant that would hit just the bottom of my sneakers at the heel (without dragging on the ground) while also having some break on the top of the shoe, but these ended up being a little shorter than i expected. if I were to order these again, i'd probably go with the large and have them tailored down if they were too long. maybe it's the material, but it felt like the elastic waist wasn't that well sewn together, though i'm probably just being picky. fyi, there is no drawstring to help make these tighter, but there are belt loops.;;hey, are the vuja de pants skinny around your thighs? and are the pants longer than ankle? i‚Äôm 6‚Äô0 and 64kgs so should i go size M or L?","{upvote:2,timestamp:2023-08-12}",Reddit,0,
"LV,Gucci","quality,popular","FIND - Giant Gucci list - Gucci Gang Hi guys, now when I can't get answers on my Gucci questions, I decided to look even deeper, and I have now made a list with diffrent pieces I have found. And yes, most of the pieces are from Weidian, but there are also links to taobao. It will only involve tees, hoodies, sweatshirts and pants, because bags and wallets are easy to find through Darcy or Nina. Some of the items will come from the same seller, and I have only handpicked some of the more ""unseen"" items, so popular pieces are not included, since you can find them pretty easy on this sub. Feel free to discover more.I have not bought any of the pieces - I have however only bought the Snow White tee, and will make a QC on it, when it arrives at the warehouse. I will update this if I find more pieces - If you are looking for something specific, let me know and I will try to find it.Enjoy!

Lean?  **BACKGROUND INFORMATION BEFORE READING REVIEW**  **ALL SIZING INFORMATION IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IS IN USA SIZES**   Retail clothing references incase my fit opinions are confusing or require some referencing. I wear size small in everything. They usually fit true to size, not too snug not too baggy. Medium gives me a nice oversized fit, I can tuck in my shirt without stretching the shirt. Couple of items I bought retail are skate brand hoodies (thrasher, primitive, etc) in size small and they fit tts. Shirts I bought retail, Nike Stussy International Tee in size small fits me oversized, Supreme 5 boroughs tee size medium fits me oversized similar to the Nike Stussy. CDG Heart shirt size Small fits me kind of tight. Uniqlo I typically buy Medium for TTS and Large for oversized. I wear pants USA 29x30 if I can find it or USA 30x30 but I need a belt. Examples would be RSQ London Skinny 30x30 or Hollister Skinny Jeans 30x30. Both I wear with belts or else they sag a little.  Lurked for about a month then decided to pull the trigger on getting a haul. I don't own any retail of any of the items except 1 pair of Eric Emanuel Shorts so I won't really comment on closeness to authenticity. If you have any questions regarding the haul (process, prices, anything I missed) feel free to leave them in the comments and I'll try to get back to you. If you have no questions **PLEASE LEAVE A W2C OF YOUR FAVORITE T-SHIRTS, RINGS, PANTS OR ITEMS YOU THINK I MIGHT BE WILLING TO GP** for my next haul.  **QUALITY RATING DOES NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION PRICE**  **PRICE RATING SLIGHTLY TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION QUALITY**  **RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PURELY SUBJECTIVE AND BASED OFF IN HAND EXPERIENCE**  **W2C LINKS MIGHT CONTAIN SOME RANDOM PERSON'S REFERRAL LINKS BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO PICK STUFF FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S HAULS THAT I LIKED AND BOOKMARKED THE W2C LINK THAT THEY PROVIDED.

If I were to compare to something retail, its closest to a [Pro Club Heavyweight Shirt](https://shopproclub.com/pro-club-men-s-heavyweight-cotton-short-sleeve-crew-neck-t-shirt) in terms of weight, thickness and sizing. It's just ever so slightly thinner. Fits relatively oversized. Giving it a 5/10 for price due to almost 20 dollars. Giving it a maybe recommendation due to price for a rep shirt that says 2 words on it. But it is a thick shirt it feels nice, but Pro clubs are 6 bucks and this is 3x the price.   **BALENCIAGA CAMPAIGN BLACK T SHIRT**  [W2C](https://to2dayclub.x.yupoo.com/albums/96975777?uid=1) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/GUvrhae) == [INHAND](https://imgur.com/a/OqtpjDc)  WEIGHT: 313 G  SIZE: S  COST: 88 YUAN OR $13.20 USD  Ordered: 2021-09-11 11:32  Arrived: 2021-09-16 13:38  Quality: 8/10 == Price: 7/10 == Recommend: Yes  Thoughts:  Slightly thinner than the Acne Studios T Shirt. If I were to compare to a retail piece it is similar to the [Nike Stussy International Tee](https://www.stussy.com/products/m-nrg-ss-tee-zr-1) in terms of thickness and quality of material. The heat press is alright. I've seen better, but I've also seen worse. If you are able to zoom in there's some chips in the heat press. Has an oversized fit. Giving it a yes recommendation because $13 is better than the hundreds of dollars this retails for. Also this was like the cheapest by like 10-20 yuan from 3 other sellers I compared to.  **HAN SOLO'S NIKE CENTER SWOOSH T SHIRT GREY AND KHAKI**  [W2C](https://hansolo1.x.yupoo.com/albums/97395066?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=3698247) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/283QJXO) == [INHAND](https://imgur.com/a/0k96sEv)  WEIGHT: 260 G EACH  SIZE: S (for both)  COST: 78 YUAN x 2 OR $11.70 x 2 USD  Ordered: 2021-09-10 20:33 (for both)  Arrived: 2021-09-14 13:07 (for both)  Quality: 8/10 == Price: 8/10 == Recommend: Yes  Thoughts:  Tried and true t shirt. Reviews are all over the subreddit. If I were to compare to a retail piece the material is very similar to this [ASSC London Shirt](https://www.antisocialsocialclub.com/products/london-charcoal-tee?variant=30369783218251) I own. However it fits bigger than it. More similar to the Nike Stussy International T-Shirt, just 1 cm shorter. Giving it a yes recommendation because it's the fashionreps uniform.  **SUBWAY HOOLIGAN'S ESSENTIAL HOODIES BLACK AND TEAL**  [W2C](https://hunter0824.x.yupoo.com/albums/86231331?uid=1) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/3jdjCDb) == [INHAND](https://imgur.com/a/xtYnHAj)  WEIGHT: 720 G EACH  SIZE: S (for both)  COST: 219 YUAN x 2 OR $32.85 x 2 USD  Ordered: 2021-09-10 20:35 (for both)  Arrived: 2021-09-14 20:33 (Teal)  Arrived: 2021-09-15 09:57 (Black)  Quality: 9/10 == Price 10/10 == Recommend: Yes  Thoughts:  A lot of Essentials sellers, I just picked the one that had both colors of the size I wanted in stock. I don't own retail essentials so I can't comment on accuracy. However, one thing I noticed is on the Black one the essentials embroidery on the sleeve is on the right arm, and on the Teal one the embroidery on the sleeve is on the left arm. No clue which one is correct, or if both are correct, essentials experts can chime in. The reflective words are reflective. It's soft inside, similar to [Independent Trading Co](https://www.independenttradingco.com/) which is like 99% of your typical skate brand (Hundreds, Primitive, Thrasher) hoodie blanks, according to my experience. Fits oversized, which is what I assume retail essentials is supposed to fit. Giving it a 9/10 because the embroidery on the arms is kind of uneven on some of the letters and because I don't know which arm is suppose to have the embroidery. But I've paid like $80+ dollars for retail hoodies that don't fit and feel as great as this one so I'm giving it a recommend.  **NELLY BLANK HOODIES OLIVE, RED WINE, APRICOT**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.181f2e8dQbwkxg&id=599885031160&_u=h2pt021i1eb6) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/VKcHAse) == [INHAND](https://imgur.com/a/x3tC4Ro)  WEIGHT: 525 G EACH  SIZE: S (for all 3)  COST: 47 YUAN x 3 OR $7.05 USD x 3  Ordered: 2021-09-11 10:45 (for all 3)  Arrived: 2021-09-13 16:24 (for all 3)  Quality: 7/10 == Price 10/10 == Recommend: Depends  Thoughts:  Haven't seen many people buy it recently. I was expecting a thicker hoodie, these hoodies are pretty thin. The are all lined on the inside with this soft faux fur type material so it's warm despite being thin. They fit tight though, which is not what I was expecting. Also all 3 tags are different if that matters at all, doesn't to me. Giving it a 7/10 for quality due to the thinness (not taking price into consideration), but it saves some points in being very soft on the inside. I think it's a good hoodie if you want to layer, but I highly recommend sizing up a size or even two, as this small size fits so small that I look like I'm wearing hand-me-downs. For $7 a hoodie I can't really complain, but I probably won't wear these and I'ma give them away or something.  **NIKE RETRO BASEBALL STYLE JACKET BEIGE**  [W2C](https://shop1766625616.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3695363016) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/y4IoXgo) == [INHAND](https://imgur.com/a/2do4G6B)  WEIGHT: 505 G  SIZE: M  COST: 139 YUAN OR $20.85 USD  Ordered: 2021-09-11 09:30  Arrived: 2021-09-15 10:18  Quality: 9.9/10 == Price: 10/10 == Recommend: MUST COP  Thoughts:  Easily my favorite clothing piece that I copped. I have no idea if it's fantasy or not. It gives me vibes of when this [Nike Chinese Bomber Jacket](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/aa/b3/50/aab35033d0f930add8095c657f3dba18.jpg) was very popular, but was also probably a fantasy piece as well. The quality is amazing. Can't give it a 10/10 quality, due to the right arm sleeve stripes are not lined up properly (QC photo 2), but whatever. The inside is lined with this silky smooth material and feels great. The outside is almost like a matted nylon material. Great heft to the jacket. The buttons snap nicely. I highly recommend buying this. I might buy more just to ensure I have this in my rotation indefinitely or if they stop making it. Can't recommend it enough, especially for $20.  **NIKE CARGO PANTS BLACK**  [W2C](https://shop1648679456.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3107923938) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/45Ze1g7) == [INHAND](https://imgur.com/a/k25KAPB)  WEIGHT: 642 G  SIZE: L  COST: 95 YUAN OR $14.25 USD  Ordered: 2021-09-11 09:30  Arrived: 2021-09-14 14:26  Quality: 8/10 == Price: 10/10 == Recommend: Depends  Thoughts:  These pants are a very weird sizing for me. Length wise, they are a little short on me still, despite ordering a large. However waist and thigh wise, they are a little baggy. Tying the strings together makes it fit a little better, but it's still baggier than I was hoping. If you want the baggier look I guess they'll be fine, but it's still a very awkward sizing overall. I was hoping for a slimmer look, but ordering a size smaller it'd be too cropped for me. Even now it's pretty cropped to the point where I'd probably won't wear any low top shoes with these. Quality wise they are pretty good. There's decent weight to the pants. The inside is soft. Ribbed jogger like leg openings, silky smooth pockets. Since most people seem like to like baggier cargos, then you can go for it. I personally wanted something slightly more tapered and longer. Might try to at least get these tailored around my leg and thigh.   **SIDE NOTE**  WeGoBuy QC sent me flaws but seller did not accept my return. I had them shipped anyways and I don't see them anymore, so it was probably dust or something.  **PAYDAY'S ERIC EMANUEL SHORTS BLACK AND SKY BLUE**  [W2C](https://payday244.x.yupoo.com/albums/99145709?uid=1) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/o50jjBB) == [INHAND](https://imgur.com/a/hrKDAde) == [RETAIL](https://imgur.com/a/93yhzwU)  WEIGHT: 230 G EACH  SIZE: M  COST: 75 YUAN OR $11.25 USD  Ordered: 2021-09-10 20:35  Arrived: 2021-09-13 17:06  Quality: 9/10 == Price: 10/10 == Recommend: MUST COP (if you want EE shorts)  Thoughts:  So I actually have a retail pair in hand, the green ones. Mind you retail EE shorts are $108 dollars after shipping, so for a 1/10th the price these are a MUST COP. There's two main differences between these and retail and one small difference. First main is the authenticity tag is missing on the rep (check retail photos). Second main is the bag is slightly different color wise (check inhand photos). The small difference is the stickers on the packaging (different size sticker and the Chinese barcode. Otherwise unless you carry the bag around or if you take off your pants to let someone QC your shorts, these are pretty good reps. They are raspy like the retails, they fit like retails, and they're slightly see through like retails. Highly recommend if you don't want to pay over $100 for mesh shorts.  **PATTA ASIA CITY TOUR HAT WHITE**  [W2C](https://to2dayclub.x.yupoo.com/albums/95975586?uid=1) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/GBqkgPO) == [INHAND](https://imgur.com/a/ps90kWx)  WEIGHT: 119 G  SIZE: ONE SIZE  COST: 58 YUAN OR $8.70 USD  Ordered: 2021-09-11 11:32  Arrived: 2021-09-17 11:19  Quality: 8/10 == Price: 10/10 == Recommend: Depends  Thoughts:  I own a [Nike Heritage 86 hat](https://www.nike.com/t/sportswear-heritage-86-adjustable-cap-Hhj5Rr/943091-010) so I'm going to compare the Patta hat to it. The hat got flattened during shipping, so I had to bend the brim back. The overall structure on the hat is a little flimsier than the Heritage 86. The stitching is a little wonky and inconsistent on the city names, but not that big of a deal. I paid full price for the Heritage 86 so $8 for this Patta is alright. I would recommend it if you don't mind that this is probably a fantasy cap.  **SOCKS**  [W2C Nike](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=618077075060) == [W2C CALABASAS](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=584581816009) == [QC AND INHAND](https://imgur.com/a/IQ2qas4)  WEIGHT: 85 G NIKE  WEIGHT: 177 G CALABASAS  SIZE: ONE SIZE  COST Nike: 7.90 YUAN X 6 OR $1.18 USD X 6  COST Calabasas: 16 YUAN X 4 OR $2.40 USD X 4  Ordered: 2021-09-11 09:49 (for all)  Arrived: 2021-09-14 17:11 (for all)  Quality: 10/10 == Price: 10/10 == Recommend: MUST COP  Thoughts:  Everyone buys these Nike socks. Some complain they're too thin, but comparing them to my [retail](https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/p/nike-everyday-cushioned-training-crew-socks-6-pack-20nikmnkvrydycshcapa/20nikmnkvrydycshcapa?sku=21553249) socks they feel exactly the same. The Calabasas ones however, are noticeably slightly thicker. I saw people recommending to get the ones that say Towel Bottom, which is the ones I got, which is why they are 16 yuan instead of 12 yuan. Maybe that's the reason they're thicker? I don't know. But overall great socks can't go wrong with $1-$2 socks.

It's a 3 dollar bracelet. You get what you paid for. It feels pretty cheap, there's not much weight to it. It sits on my wrist fine, but I kind of just bought it on a whim to see if I like the style. However the photos do make it look flatter than it actually is in person. In person it's rounded throughout. I might have liked it more if it was actually flat like the photos. Cop if you like it, pretty subjective item.  **Minimalist, cool wind, wild, simple, solid color, flat bracelet design, fashion, personality adjustment, male and female matching bracelets**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-21327857446.16.3054763750aimv&id=558106640625) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/PI5N8G0) == [INHAND](https://imgur.com/a/vnvgEjf)  WEIGHT: 13 G  SIZE: 17.5 CM SILVER  COST: 35 YUAN OR $5.25 USD  Ordered: 2021-09-11 10:45  Arrived: 2021-09-12 21:09  Quality: 6/10 == Price: 10/10 == Recommend: Depends  Thoughts:  Again, I'm not taking price into quality rating. It's a 5 dollar bracelet. You get what you paid for. It feels pretty cheap, there's not much weight to it. It sits on my wrist fine, but I kind of just bought it on a whim to see if I like the style. I do like this one better than the first one. The clasp is a little flimsy but it works. Cop if you like it, pretty subjective item. Although as I'm making this it seems only a Rose gold colored one is available.  **CHROME HEARTS FOREVER RING**  [W2C](https://husky-reps.x.yupoo.com/albums/98631599?uid=1) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/BOWQiws) == [INHAND](https://imgur.com/a/eC4Zt5b)  WEIGHT: 82 G  SIZE: 9  COST: 108 YUAN OR $16.20 USD  Ordered: 2021-09-11 09:36  Arrived: 2021-09-16 15:59  Quality: 7/10 == Price: 8/10 == Recommend: Depends  Thoughts:  I have no clue how accurate it is. It came pretty tarnished, almost looking like a mood ring. I'm pretty sure I can just use the cloth and clean it up but I'm too lazy at the moment. The pictures show that the ring engravings should be filled in with black, but mine isn't. I got a Size 9. It is way to big for my ring and pinky fingers. It is slightly too big for my middle and index fingers. It fits my thumb. Overall it's not bad I think. I have zero experience with jewelry. It has a slight weight to it. I would probably order this again, but in a smaller size. I bought larger sizes for all my rings as a test fit because I was afraid they wouldn't fit. Probably going to reorder smaller sizes in next haul.  **GUCCI GHOST RING**  [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3656042543) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/uW4LnJA) == [INHAND](https://imgur.com/a/22uuHl2)  WEIGHT: 51 G  SIZE: 9  COST: 39 YUAN OR $5.85 USD  Ordered: 2021-09-11 14:23  Arrived: 2021-09-17 15:25  Quality: 7/10 == Price: 10/10 == Recommend: Depends  Thoughts:  I have no clue how accurate it is. It has some blemish on the inside (inhand photos). It's overall pretty thin. Still too big for my pinky and ring fingers. It fits better on my middle and index fingers than the Chrome Hearts Forever Ring, but it will still come off if I shake my fingers hard enough. Overall it's not bad I think. I have zero experience with jewelry. I would probably order this again, but in a smaller size.  **HUMAN MADE DUCK BLANKET**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=632473453193&ali_trackid=2:mm_119784642_132400295_36218700225) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/iskI770) == [INHAND](https://imgur.com/a/Dt1RXR1)  WEIGHT: 799 G  SIZE: 125*150  COST:  78 YUAN OR $11.70 USD  Ordered: 2021-09-10 20:46  Arrived: 2021-09-13 20:13  Quality: 10/10 == Price: 10/10 == Recommend: MUST COP  Thoughts:  Accurate? Fantasy? I have no idea honestly. But I love it. My 2nd favorite item behind the Nike Baseball Jacket. For $12 bucks maybe I hang it on a wall, use it as a rug, put it on the couch, whatever. Love the design and the colors. Highly recommend copping. Honestly tempted to just buy the other 3.  **APPLE'S BURBERRY REVERSIBLE LONDON CHECK BELT**  [W2C](https://apple-reddit.x.yupoo.com/albums/90324655?uid=1) == QC (NOT AVAILABLE) == [INHAND](https://imgur.com/a/Olqo50n)  WEIGHT: N/A  SIZE: 30-33  COST: 300 YUAN + 180 SHIPPING = $74 USD + 3.7 PAYPAL FEE  Ordered: 2021-09-08  QC PICS SENT: 2021-09-09  TRACKING NUMBER SENT: 2021-09-13  ARRIVED: 2021-09-23  Quality: 7/10 == Price: 5/10 == Recommend: No  Thoughts:  Pretty pricey coming in at $77. I wore the belt like 2 times before I took the pictures for this review. As you can see it already has a bend and creases in the belt. The belt is slightly too big for me but I can make it work. Overall the belt doesn't feel like amazing quality. But it doesn't feel awful. For $77 dollars I would pass, but I kind of felt obligated to buy it because I had someone else do the ordering and communicating for me and I didn't want them to go through the trouble for nothing.

My friend owns a real one and compared to it it's pretty close. The weight thickness and size is there. Color is pretty accurate. For what is essentially $60 shipped, I much like this belt better than the one I got from Apple. But to be fair they are two completely different belts. The last two QC photos are pictures of what I thought were scratches so I RL'd it, but they confirmed that it was just dust or something and after receiving it in hand they aren't there.  For the Blaze:  I hate it. But it's not their fault it's mine. I thought these were regular Club Masters and not the Blaze version. Completely my fault that I didn't pay close enough attention. I do not like these glasses personally. I wish I noticed sooner, but I didn't notice until I actually received them that they weren't the normal club masters. Still, a good product, if it's what you're looking for.  For the Aviator:  I like it with some reserves. First it's pretty tight on my face. I tried to unscrew it, but the screws kept stripping so I ended up carefully bending the temples outward until it stopped clamping on my face. [Also I actually ordered the wrong one so here are the QC photos for the yellow one I accidentally ordered in case anyone wanted those.](https://imgur.com/a/k0Gzomn) Lucy, was the one who replied and took care of my order. She was very nice and understanding and helped me get the black ones.  Brother Sam's prices are definitely on the steep end, but you get what you pay for. These items are pretty solid and feel great. I had a pleasant customer service experience, it was easy to navigate and order and I got my items pretty quickly.  **BONUS STUFF**  Here's some QC photos of stuff I either ordered and returned or items that weren't for me.  **FOG BASEBALL JERSEY BLACK**  [W2C](https://husky-reps.x.yupoo.com/albums/94496182?uid=1) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/mzopyEB)  SIZE: S  COST: 108 YUAN OR $16.20 USD  Thoughts:  I refunded it cause it was too small length wise and I wasn't willing to wait to have a replacement come in before I shipped out my haul.  **NIKE PARIS HAT**  [W2C](https://to2dayclub.x.yupoo.com/albums/96636147?uid=1) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/RnCHHoc)  SIZE: ONE SIZE  COST: 58 YUAN OR $8.70 USD  Thoughts:  I refunded due to the quality control picture of the stitching. Upon closer inspection of the W2C link, you can see the same stitching issues in listing. My fault for not paying closer attention to it.  **TEENAGE CLUB BLACK BOGO HOODIE FW 16**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=560665219785) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/E25ZC56)  SIZE: S  COST: 298.98 YUAN OR $$44.85 USD  Thoughts:  Girlfriend bought this and took it before I could get photos. One of my friends says it looks pretty solid, but the wash tags might be a little off???  **ROUNDED CHROME HEARTS RING**  [W2C](https://shop1648679456.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4348651911&spider_token=4572) == [QC](https://imgur.com/a/P34eXbC)  SIZE: 10 YARD  COST: 30 YUAN OR $4.50 USD  Thoughts:  Bought this in a 10 YARD just to see how big it is. It's way to big for me and I ended up giving it to a friend before I could take any photos. Also I didn't really like how the roundedness looked on my fingers. But maybe I'll order a 6 YARD or something. It's only 5 bucks.  **FINAL COMMENTS**  Overall haul experience, was okay. Wish it didn't get stuck at the airport for so long. It arrived in the USA on October 8 but didn't get to me for another 22 days. Would probably suck it up and pay extra for UPS or Fed-Ex for next haul. Size charts are pretty accurate but also be sure to look at QC photos for sizing. Spending the extra 20 yuan for rehearsal shipping can save you a little bit, but estimates are pretty accurate. T-shirts can be pretty overpriced. Higher quality items are higher priced. Shopping direct is faster, but more expensive. Yupoo albums are great. Love it when a seller has a Yupoo album and a taobao link. Shipping is expensive. Reps do not save you any money cause you end up buying more reps than you would retail. With that said, next haul coming eventually.;;Dope review üî•","{upvote:3,timestamp:2021-11-01}",Reddit,1,1

"LV,Burberry,YSL","quality,haul","[Review] Big Clothing Haul from Made by KungFu | Superbuy [Chrome Hearts Cashmere Sweater Size S](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6766708432)   Overall Quality of the Knitted Cashmere Sweater is great, I own other retail cashmere products and was shook when i unboxed it. It has a super nice soft touch and feels very nice wearing, most items feel rather scratchy but this one does not have that issue. Nice fabric quality is a major factor for me when i buy rep items so this is definitely a win for me. The Leather patches are Soft leather and feel super smooth, on the back there is a 925 Silver Chrome Hearts Badge, no clue if it actually is silver but it compares to my other silver products that i own. I also made a close up macro picture of the Fabric with my 15 pro max for those interested. Personally I'd give this product a high recommendation for those people who are interested in good fabric products.

[Yves Saint Laurent Flower Silk Shirt Size 37](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6632387582)  I'm a huge fan of silk products and own many many silk items so getting KungFu his silk products was a no brainer for me. The flower shirt is rather on the thinner side of silk(which is not bad), I'd consider it a Summer shirt, if i had to guess i would say its 16 momme. The silk quality is outstanding though and feels super nice on the body, definitely one of the more comfortable items.  &#x200B;  [YSL Flower Silk Shirt](https://preview.redd.it/7ag4le0kpp5c1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ac6a69d352c0fc1dccf3d845f9ea38375ef0891)  3. [Yves Saint Laurent Black Silk Shirt Size 37](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6765701081)  Like the flower shirt, this is just a great piece even though they are different. The black silk shirt is definitely thicker compared to the flower shirt I'd assume its 19 momme hence it makes the silk feel even softer/smoother, big recommend.  [YSL Silk Shirt in Black](https://preview.redd.it/gnx9fsprpp5c1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=032bd0d7433aba1b3419581ddb99fecfabb5cbfc)  4. [MiuMiu Polo Sweater Size S](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6765710783)  Personally one of my ""bigger favorites"" I have always been a massive fan of MiuMiu, so seeing a rep of it getting made definitely made me happy so i had to get it. It's very oversized and gives a boxy look, the length is more fitted and has the bottom similar to a bomber so its snug on the body, inside feels similar to fleece fabric so it has a high wear comfort. The logo also has a really good placement, i attached a picture of it.  [MiuMiu Sweater Polo Front](https://preview.redd.it/stw4ih82qp5c1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8957a8d719d484df8ac6d74e3f667605461c8976)  [MiuMiu Close up of Logo](https://preview.redd.it/oc4rsde3qp5c1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=848d945446ade939ca9de07ac0a38d9008954380)  5. [Burberry Rain/Trench coat Size S](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6707621849)  The Burberry Trench feels like every other Raincoat. The alignment of the Burberry checker logo is really good and compares to my retail products i have from Burberry. It's reversible and also has a black side with a Burberry Badge (stitching is decent on it). The black inside is waterproof i also tested it and it works just fine so definitely a good cop for when it rains.  [Burberry Trench Front](https://preview.redd.it/mt5saamaqp5c1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc2233e5bff8f2eb603bd1cccda61c65cff21c6b)  6. [Fendi Shirt Jacket Size S](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6632428058&spider_token=f83a)  I like Fendi a lot and I'm into the Shirt Jacket style so i gave it a try, most of those Fendi items always have a problem with alignment. The one from KungFu is decent compared to others but the alignment of the pockets still could have been better. Overall the quality of it is good, the inside is nylon I'm pretty sure but doesn't feel that plasticy so it's nice to wear. For people that like Fendi and this style I'd recommend it but for those that are rather nit picky about alignment and everything i would not buy it even though I've seen better pieces than mine from KungFu but i do not mind it much.  [Fendi Shirt Jacket Front](https://preview.redd.it/1sacl20gqp5c1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5439f63ff07acc6b40fe9c1039ce0536ae07257a)  7. [Maison Margiela Suit Set Size 48](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6632453324)  The Margiela Suit is really nice compared to other Suits i had before, Fabric is good Quality and the open style of the suit top definitely makes it look more ""casual"" to wear which i really like a lot, Pants are straight cut and look good when wearing, but are a bit tight on the waist so i should definitely have went a size up. The sewing of the Tag is also good and shows good alignment of the back and is very symmetric. I got a retail Margiela hoodie and the Tag sewing looks pretty much the same.  [Margiela Top and Pants](https://preview.redd.it/k6hwoxykqp5c1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72e4d5973d6c9988a6737600d5ab03bfe5203519)  For Shipping i've used Superbuy since their service is always outstanding and i always get great help from my friend u/TommySuperbuy regarding any issues I've ever had, so I highly recommend their service. Shipping took about 8 Days from China to my doorstep with the Tax Free Air Preferential Line. For any additional questions everyone can feel free to DM me or leave a comment.

Uniqlo,"waste,price,haul","This sub is a trap If you're dumb like me then yeah this sub is such a trap. My first haul was about 3 years ago and it was only about 3kg. I took a long break and finally came back recently and I spent so much money on things I didn't need it was insane. It's like an addiction. It started with reps and then I started buying other things like unbranded shirts, coats, shoes, and pants. Then I realized... I can just buy this stuff from Uniqlo or other places for around the same price and without the huge shipping costs. Anyway I don't know what the point of this post was because I'm happy with the few things I decided to keep, but damn I hope y'all don't waste money on things you can buy locally instead lol;;Repmakers make a living off selling to children in highschool because you kids have zero self control","{upvote:14,timestamp:2020-06-05}",Reddit,1,0

Definitely worth the money. Not going to wow anyone with comfort but looks great and it isn't itchy.  Fit: Length is TTS but the fit otherwise feels a little larger, so it fits me perfectly  Comfort: Warmer than I expected, definitely for 35F to 50F weather. Sherpa material could be softer IMO but interested to see how a delicate wash changes that. Weighs a decent amount as well  Accuracy: Looks pretty similar to the one on Patagonia's website. Sherpa material on outside was a little smushed from packaging, still need to delicately wash to ""bring to life""  IMG: Image wouldn't upload on its own, see overview pic: [https://i.imgur.com/GM7y1NQ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/GM7y1NQ.jpg)  Yupoo: [https://husky-reps.x.yupoo.com/albums/103377454?uid=1](https://husky-reps.x.yupoo.com/albums/103377454?uid=1) (Looks like link has since died or else I would've provided the taobao, apologies!)  \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Patagonia Packable Rain Jacket - sz L¬† - Grey - 148 yuan - HuskyReps  Review: 10/10 - I almost threw this thing away until I held it under the faucet and tested it. This rain jacket is so thin and light that it feels like you'd be soaked in 15 seconds. After running the hose over my arm with it on for over a minute my arm was still bone dry. I have no clue how this thing works as well as it does for how thin the material is but it's amazing. Super lightweight and easily packed. Would be a great hiking accessory or to keep in the car for emergencies. Great summer rain jacket (again VERY THIN). Sadly it didn't fit me so I gave it to a friend for free. Definitely going to re-order 2 more in a size up in more interesting colors. Cannot recommend enough at $24.  Fit: The length is longer (since it's a rain jacket) but is tight for the size. Hugged my body tighter than skinny jeans grab my tree trunk thighs but went past my pant pockets in length. If you're a slimmer to regular build then TTS and if you're a regular to larger build then size up probably.  Comfort: If you're wearing it in warm weather this thing is amazingly light and airy. The material feels as thin as tissue paper but doesn't feel fragile. Not for 65F or less IMO.  Accuracy: Patagonia rain jackets are a dime a dozen. I see them everywhere and would have no way of calling this out unless inspecting from a few inches away.

I was sweating in 5 minutes of wearing these at room temperature (70F ish). Definitely cold weather joggers, you'd die in these in 65F+ weather. Super super soft material on the inside and very comfortable. A little loose for what most of my joggers (Nike & Adidas) run.  Fit: If you're split between two sizes then go with the smaller one. I'd say if you want a baggier/loose fit then go TTS (even with my massive thighs). Length is slightly longer than TTS as well IMO. Going to see if I can shrink the hell out of them in the dryer to get them tighter. Remind me if you want to know and I'll update or comment after washing.  Comfort: As mentioned above, super super soft. Inner materials are the softest joggers I've ever felt. Outside is the perfect amount of softness without feeling too fragile or destroyable. 643 grams.  Accuracy: Took a leap of faith on these, that's why they're 9/10 IMO. Not too sure on accuracy but looks pretty similar to the FOG pics of these. Call me out if I'm wrong in saying they look decent.  NOTE: I WILL BE SELLING THESE ON FASHIONREPSBST HERE SHORTLY SINCE THEY ARE TOO BIG FOR ME  IMG: \[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/3ixDYrG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3ixDYrG.jpg)) // [https://imgur.com/a/FZJet6I](https://imgur.com/a/FZJet6I)  W2C: [https://husky-reps.x.yupoo.com/albums/101736029?uid=1](https://husky-reps.x.yupoo.com/albums/101736029?uid=1) (Looks like link has since died or else I would've provided the taobao, apologies!)  \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Nike Tech Fleece Joggers - sz XL - Black on Black - 195 yuan - AlaskaReps (HuskyReps)  Review: 6/10 - They look the part but not sure if they feel the part. Never tried on retail tech fleece joggers (can't justify paying $100+ for joggers). Everyone raves about the comfort of the retails but these are just alright. Feel like normal joggers to me but definitely assuming that the reps aren't as nice as the retails. They do feel like $60 joggers at least and for \~$30 that's not a bad deal. Wish I had gotten a more interesting colorway as well which probably plays into them feeling just like normal Nike joggers.  Fit: If you like a tapered, tighter-fitting jogger then these are TTS. If you want them to be baggier then I'd size up. Length is TTS. The tightness of these definitely has something to do with ya boi's thicc thighs, so if you're slimmer they'll probably be spot on at TTS.  Comfort: For a tighter fitting jogger (for me) they're pretty comfy. Decently warm too. Not warm enough for below freezing like the essentials mentioned above, but definitely too warm to wear in 75F+ weather. Again, not super soft, they feel just like normal $60 Nike or Adidas joggers.  Accuracy: I have no clue what I'm talking about here either but no one is calling you out on these IMO. Especially on the all-black pair, no one can see any of the details to call you out anyways.

Had WeGoBuy measure the insole and it measured like a standard US 13. Waaay skinnier than my retail AF1s. Like a whole size or half size smaller in width. Length is the exact same. Super frustrating as I wear my beat-up retails all the time and can't seem to find a similar-sized rep on the cheap for the life of me. I can wear them with the insoles taken out but then they lose some of the comfort. As far as the leather feel it definitely is a little plasticky but not terrible. For $20 if you have skinnier than normal feet then it's an amazing deal.  Fit: If you have a skinnier to normal-sized foot (unlike my wide stompers) then they'll probably fit TTS. I'd recommend a half a size up at least for anyone with regular to wider feet.  Comfort: You get what you pay for but they're comfier than old skool vans (which are like $60 now). Probably more comfy if I was able to leave the insole in.  Accuracy: C'mon, they're Air Force 1's. Use the reps as your beaters and if you care about someone calling out your AF1s then just buy some retails. I'm sure the toe box on these is a little off but again for $20 I really don't care lol.

Figured my write-ups were detailed enough. If you're newer and don't know where the links are in Yupoo, the seller typically puts the Taobao link in the description at the top of the item's page. I used measurements of my own clothes to compare to the seller's measurements to pick sizes rather than just looking at sizes on the seller's pages (probably your best option if you have clothes that you like the fit of and want a similar fit).¬†;;Great job fam.

"Nike,LV,Prada","quality,price,haul","What's your strategy / mentality for purchasing reps? When I first learned of the rep marketplace, agents, etc., I was amazed and very excited to build my first haul and buy clothes that were otherwise too expensive. As most probably do, I ended up buying quite a few items I didn't really care for (mainly Fear of God Essentials at the suggestion of others lol) and I ended up spending around $150 including shipping.  Got a nice dopamine rush from building and successfully shipping my first haul, so I started making a second haul of items like Nike sweatpants, shoes, and some designer like LV. When I thought about it however, after shipping the Nike clothes were basically the same price if not more expensive than retail on sale, and for shoes it made more sense just buying the retail ones for better quality when factoring shipping from China (obviously not applicable for collector shoes). Then as I started browsing this sub-reddit and seeing others fits I realized (at least in my opinion) wearing a $2000 designer shirt like LV / Prada while driving around in my Honda Accord just looks stupid, so I've decided against buying designer. Not to mention most of the fits I've seen here of individuals in full designer look completely tacky / fake.   Of course I know ""it doesn't matter what others think"", and ""buy what you think looks good"", but the reality is that most people are buying the reps for the status / impression it leaves on others in the first place.   Going forward I think I'll still buy reps, but most likely just odd items and one offs. For clothing I've actually found after all my research into fashion / brands that I prefer unbranded funnily enough.;;Most of the stuff here looks tacky af tbh.

[This is the style](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/search/pins/?rs=ac&len=2&q=90s%20witchy%20outfits&eq=90s%20witch&etslf=3135) I'm talking about and I'm not sure if there's another term for it! It's an aesthetic I've been obsessed with since I saw Practical Magic as a child and grew up watching Friends & Charmed where the earlier seasons featured outfits similar to this style.  I'm a plus sized girl on a budget and I want to buy more clothing pieces and accessories based on this style. I'm terrible with fashion and styling things so I'd love for someone to point me in the direction of a plus sized influencer with this style.  I'm based in the US and sadly thrift shops suck in my town. Also needing a heavy emphasis on comfortable fabrics as I live in Texas and don't deal well in heat.;;I wish I could give you my wardrobe from Torrid circa 2000 when they first opened and were basically hot topic for the big gals. ü•≤ But for real you might try looking for vintage torrid pieces from then, maybe on eBay? If you search ‚Äúvintage torrid goth‚Äù you‚Äôll get some relevant results I think.  In Chicago I‚Äôve seen several plus size folks dress some variety of this style. Luv Sick Vintage is a store local to here but I think they sell on instagram and their website, they definitely have had some pieces that are this aesthetic","{upvote:3,timestamp:2023-12-10}",Reddit,0,

This is a new account so I can split out my professional & personal Reddit users.  I also have another haul of similar stuff on the way that I will review in the next week.  **Stats**   179cm / 70kg   Athletic Build   30/31"" for bottoms   S (tts) for tops  All items purchased via WegoBuy agent and shipped with EMS  (218Y / ¬£25). The parcel took 12 days in total to reach me in the UK.  **Thom Browne Cotton Sweater** (TaylorBack)   Price: 380Y / ¬£40   Size: 1   Rating: 7/10 (marked down for fit, loose stitching and just not living up to my expectations of TB)  **Review** \- I've wanted one of these since forever - but actually a little disappointed with it upon receipt. Sizing comes up pretty small, this could simply be TTS as TB is about that fitted aesthetic. It still fits, but in hindsight, I probably would have sized up by 1. Some loose stitching around the cuff that I would not have expected given the (relatively) high price.  I haven't had retail in hand, but I would expect the cotton to be softer, and the sweater more comfortable.  This was one of my grail items when I got into reps - slightly disappointed.  https://preview.redd.it/j064nxojzz751.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=4155fcd1798f83cdfdb9d053d6f61860d4d89df2  **Stone Island Ghost Overshirt** (TopStoney)   Price: 290Y / ¬£33   Size: S   Rating: 9/10 (Can't comment on 1:1ness, but the quality is fantastic & fits well)  **Review -** I own a few retail SI pieces, and this really stacks up well against them. I've compared this to a different SI retail overshirt I own, and the quality is right up there. All details and hardware appear to be accurate. The badge looks OK to my untrained eye. Fits TTS compared to retail. Really nice piece for that low key SI look. The jacket is really comfortable and works well for a summer evening (like 15-20c) in the UK layered over a T-shirt.  https://preview.redd.it/bs8gy8hlzz751.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=3550acd3f17e488618548d882afc40ac8570b4c1  **Palm Angels Logo T-Shirt** (Signor)   Price: 98Y / ¬£11   Size: S   Rating: 9/10 (very comfy, high-quality blank)  **Review -** I wanted to add some oversize swag to my wardrobe (its mostly slim European stuff rn). Blank is good quality and nicely thicc. Logo and tags appear well placed. I think the retail version of this comes in a 2 pack with a black tee as well. Worn this as a couple of times already and been complimented on it.  Sizing is oversized but TTS, that is to say, I'm normally a small in T-shirts and the S here fits me as below.  Having looked at some of the retail PA tees - the collar \*might\* not be quite 'big' enough (like they seem to come up quite high on the neck if that makes sense) - but I don't think it's calloutable, especially as this is such a simple style).  https://preview.redd.it/lp6o570nzz751.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f5a1a85c60993a16e26e9cf0f101544fc75169b;;Ya u should have gotten size 2 at least for your size  I am 173cm and 135lb and i am in size , fitted  And also i think king studio tb is much better than taylor black.

"Uniqlo,Dior","waste,quality,price,popular","Unpopular opinion: Just because you're buying from weidian doesn't mean you've found the lowest price for the item. I've seen a general belief going around in this sub that if you're buying from a weidian link then you've got the lowest price for the item, which isn't necessarily true. Don't get me wrong, items on weidian are generally cheaper then the items on taobao and WeChat sellers, but I've seen so many people buy from a specific weidian store or link and the exact same product or similar can be found for a fraction of the price.   Example 1: There was a weidian chrome hearts Jean  that was floating around this sub for quite some time that was selling for 600-700 yuan. That's about 85-100 dollars for a pair of jeans. Like wtf, you can get Levis, H@M and Uniqlo jeans for half the price, even a quarter of the price. And people were justifying buying the product because denim is premium and when it comes to rep denim it's worth the price tag. Bullshit, no rep Jean is worth 80+. There's some unbranded chrome hearts jeans on taobao and weidian for 120-140 yuan and based on the weight of the jeans, it suggests the quality is similar to those of HM Uniqlo etc. The jeans probably cost a max of 200-300y to make and the seller is probably making a profit of 200y+ off every jean sale. You're getting ripped TF off, keep looking, just because the jeans are like 100-200 yuan and you think that's ""budget"" doesn't mean it'll be shit quality.  Example 2. There is this random seller on weidian who was selling some Dior aj1s for 840 yuan. He was advertising it as the best quality for the price.  Here's the link:https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3875754541&a=b&wfr=BuyercopyURL&share_relation=d11c00c3a82db698__1  That was a bit too much for me and I didn't think it was worth the price, and I was right. Because wood table guy comes along and brings out the EXACT SAME BATCH for half the price. Here's the link   https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3886944674&spider_token=4f6e  How can I tell? The number in the inside is the exact same as WTGS. 2023/8500. I'm almost certain that wtg and this other weidian seller has the same batch because I've looked extensively on the weidian app at 100+ Dior aj1 links and the shoes in the links that have the same number always look the same. I doubt that it's just coincidence that both shoes from the sellers have the same number and both shoes look the same.  This is all to say that once you find a product you like on weidian, be aware that there are alot of other links for the same product and same batch in some other weidian store, and possibly for cheaper. Look through this sub for weidian stores and look for product you want and you might find it. I was looking for this one piece gshock watch, and the first link i found was 130 yuan, 2nd 100y, 3rd 80y, and 4th 69y. I think I've found the lowest price for that watch so now I'm gonna pick it up.  Take your time and try to find the product you like in another store. It's not wasted time because chances are you'll find another product you want from all those weidian stores you've been browsing.   Weidian is a gold mine for all kinds of items and I can say confidently that no less than 80% of all my items have come from weidian, and that's a generous estimate. But sometimes, the prices can be just as much and even more than those on taobao, reddit sellers, WeChat sellers etc. Don't be hasty and buy from the first link you find. Be patient and keep looking. If you've read this far, you're a real one. Imma head out now;;Agreed. Ty for this","{upvote:2,timestamp:2020-08-31}",Reddit,1,1

Definitely worse reps out there.   # Burberry shorts - XL - 170 Yuan  [https:\/\/weidian.com\/item.html?itemID=6031615674&spider\_token=4572](https://preview.redd.it/k4pccwpjud8b1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d42befdfa991aee3dc5bcec28763e7c32a0f5ef)  A much nicer print of the burberry shorts and a bit more accurate to retail. These are also pretty nice material wise. Size chart was accurate. I would opt for these are these are a cheaper version of the better batches i've seen, sellers like 8B currently charging a bit more.   &#x200B;  # Nike Socks - One size - bought with PB Points (But cheap)   [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=616770606113](https://preview.redd.it/5axt3jodud8b1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=266b6a69319e61235f1738f3b84deaed3a144a35)  Super thin Nike socks - would recommend if you just need something to layer but as stand alone socks these are pretty cheap, even by my standard.   &#x200B;  # Burberry TB Socks - One size - 29Yuan  [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=604537715571](https://preview.redd.it/xo2yipf1ud8b1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=638afa920cbdce0c56dff8208d501c4c1e29a675)  Kind of copped as a joke, kind of copped because I love them.

A great cop for summer. Zip feels solid but have found the button on top can dig in when you're putting them on.

"Louis Vuitton,LV,Hermes,Gucci,Chanel,Prada,Dior,Burberry,Ralph Lauren","quality,price","The naked truth of Reps that behind the scenes, you def don't want to ignore this thread! Hi fam, as a seller besides providing quality stuff and service I am thinking of how to make more contribution to this community hence I will share with you guys about the naked truth of Reps that behind the scenes today and first let's start from the auth stuff!  &#x200B;  1, Are all of those auth brand goods you cop from physical store made in country of origin?  A: Def not !  Some of the brand owner migrate their production line to China and other Asian countries such as Vietnam or Thailand, Malaysia just in order to reduce the cost and maintain the exorbitant profit, and hereby I show you some.  &#x200B;  \# Prada  In year 2011 May, Prada IPO in HK and then Patrizio Bertelli decides to release the fact in front of media that they have already established an firm relationship with Chinese OEM factory (Shi\*\*\* garments Co., Ltd , produce Coach as well) , besides Shi\*\*\* , there are other Chinese factory that manufacture some of the model for Prada ,  Shi\*\* is making 172, Lit\*\* is making 165, Ming\*\*\* is making 194 and 208. 80% of the stuff will be labeled in country of origin after being produced. Hence consumers start to collide the way that Prada migrate most of its production line to China and some other Asian countries which might somehow deflate the original spirit of Prada , then Prada change the label from made in China to made by Prada...again, LMAO...  \# Hermes(my keyboard language does not support to type that little mark, pls do with it)  As far as I know till now Hermes does not authorize any OEM factory in China, but it does have at least 14 OEM factories in Europe since year 2015, e.g Franche-Comte, Hericourt.   \#  Burberry  Well,  Burberry  shut down its main factory 2007 in England and migrate production line to China (Shenzhen city Guangdong province) . I show you guys some photo from authorized Chinese OEM factory of Burberry and you may have some idea how much profits that Burberry could make.  [https://imgur.com/a/ci5wpWp](https://imgur.com/a/ci5wpWp)  \# Ralph Lauren  Till now 75% RL clothing are manufactured in 2 Chinese factory (Lian\*\*\* Group/Yi\*\*group) which based in Dongguan, Qingyuan in China, for some reason I can't just totally release the whole name of these 2 factories.  That being said the auth stuff you cop in your city may from China but it is def AUTH !  and the only difference is those stuff are no longer from its country of origin, sad...isn't it ?  LMAO.......  \#  Louis Vuitton  I want say that there is no other brand official would punch so heavily on reps like LV, this company set up an anti-rep office in China(I cant release which city it is, maybe you guys know about it) and caught countless merchants booth or rep factory in the past 10 years. But there is one thing I can say is LV does have an authorized Chinese OEM factory and which is the only one left , the other 5 factories were shut down due to leaking the technology and trading original products raw material in black market.  Yes ! just because of this we know how to copy with very very slight difference to the auth ones, and those copies were called "" stock of retail "" . please be noted the "" stock of retail ""  IS REP !   \# Now let me share with you on the brands who are transparent on country of origin and those not.    Total transparent on country of origin:   Bottega Veneta   Brunello Cucinelli   Valentino   Saint Laurent   Gucci    Balenciaga   Fendi   Tod‚Äôs  Only transparent on the country where it was made:   Armani   Burberry  NOT transparent on country of origin:   Herm√®s  Louis Vuitton  Ermenegildo Zegna   Salvatore Ferragamo   Chanel    Dior    Prada    Dolce & Gabbana    Hugo Boss    Tory Burch  so , no more explanation you def know what I mean.....   Is the above content relevant with the subject of this thread?  Yes, before I come to the core part let's imagine a scenario, say someone can cast spell and make himself go transparent all of sudden and then sneak into the warehouse of iPhone company, took an iPhone and run away, and then you asking him "" is the iPhone in you hand auth or rep ?""  well, my answer is neither. This very iPhone is fully iPhone-like functional but not authentic, reason is simple this iPhone was being out of warehouse without authentic channel. So sometimes the difference between an authentic product and a rep one somewhat depends license and authentication. Without license and authentication it is rep even manufactured by original factory. As far as rep is concerned some of the Chinese rep factory can produce the stuff which barely has any difference with the auth one and we call this tier as "" stock of retail "" but the selling price for sure is the highest. Let me deep dive more to show you the tiers of those reps which common sold in community.  &#x200B;  Tier 1: Stock of retail  If some one claiming that he could source a LV purse which is a real stock of retail from original factory, then I would say he is lying, there is no real Stock of retail in the market. The so called  stock of retail is the highest quality reps you could get and with POS receipt(fake) , dust-proof bag(fake), invoice(fake), warranty card(fake), QR code(fake)...further more there are some reps which are the ""rep of the Stock of retail"" coming into market , those stuff is best quality VS price , very decent quality and lower price than Stock of retail... crazy right ? a rep can even be repped... LMAO.....  &#x200B;  Tier 2: 1:1  This tier is a bit lower quality comparing with Tier 1: Stock of retail, the major difference is the shell material and zipper it use. when we come to monogram or stitching they barely have any difference unless using a magnifier to inspect the flaw , you may find out the difference between tier 1 and tier 2 from those photo   &#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/36f5nufx9ao21.png  https://i.redd.it/iyqs8r3z9ao21.png  &#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/0qcf9692aao21.png  &#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/qlm4f0a3aao21.png  &#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/u49ny7d4aao21.png  &#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/zm7njwv4aao21.png  &#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/zclez0l5aao21.png  &#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/1o0ierb6aao21.png  &#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/p9w24w07aao21.png  &#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/d18k35k7aao21.png  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/b71r3xd8aao21.png  Unless you want to pick bones from egg otherwise there is really no need to go after Tier 1 at much higher price, as for me I choose 1:1.  &#x200B;   Tier 3:  Grade A  IMO there is no more further tier in tier 3, if there is  Grade A,  Grade AA,  Grade AAA in tier 3 the only possibility is the rep factory is suffering from  variance of raw material suppliers, which cause the batch really unstable. but you need to bear in mind that this is NOT B&S , rep factory are under massive pressure so it is normal that their suppliers change from time to time and which cause different batch even in same tier.   &#x200B;  Tier 4:  I call those as CRAP, those reps can't hold up too many years, unless you give maintenance like  to a baby. So this tier might not be a bad choice for newbie just want to taste how rep feels like, personally I don't recommend go bang at the very first, step by step is good way out.   Lastly I want to say thank you guys for voting so much great stuff in my previous thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/b4jd00/your_most_favorite_fashion_accessories_please_let/) and for sure I will source those for you, but till now I can't give you any promise that all of your desire would be fulfilled, anyway I will do my best to make them at your fingertip !  &#x200B;  My solo website selling fashion accessories  will be online very soon, even I said few days ago that it will be online in a week, but according to current progress still need few more days, hopefully **I will launch it  BEFORE 3rd April**   &#x200B;  Cheers Fam!  &#x200B;;;Yea man, that's the gateway to starting a business relationship right there.

,"quality,opinions,thoughts,comparison","2024 TNF Comparison between Husky, WWTOP and 0832 Club So recently I‚Äôve been in the hunt for the best Rep TNF nuptse in the market that is known to us rep fam which is Husky, WWTOP and 0832 club. (there might be other be other seller that has better batches on Weidian but who knows)   I‚Äôve GPed some to my Pandabuy warehouse and decided to help those people who are in search for the best rep nuptse out there.  Would appreciate some upvotes as it really took some time and effort to put into details.  Disclaimer: these are all MY opinions on which is better so feel free to comment down below if you have any thoughts.  From the embroidery logo, IMO husky nailed it the best. WWTOP has a slightly taller ‚ÄúN‚Äù and no gap in between the stripes. 0832 428Y has gap in between the lines and the ‚ÄúF‚Äù is slightly off. 0832 378Y has gap in between N, O & R.  From 700 embroidery on sleeve, I think Husky takes the win here too for quality and thickness of embroidery, WWTOP is ok but looks slightly thin. The 0832 428Y 0 has too less of a gap and 0832 378Y feels thin and too squared off.  From the top ‚Äúblue tint‚Äù honestly speaking, I personally think all of them have them but some of them might be more pronounced than others, which I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big concern. Puffiness as well, I feel like some retail pics also seems less puffy. From QC pics, I‚Äôm sure with the whole tennis ball and dryer trick will get you 0.85-0.9:1 compared to retail. Do not expect reps to be 1:1, if not, retail wouldn‚Äôt exist no more. WEAR WITH CONFIDENCE  Feel free to comment and correct me for my mistakes. Peace out and happy new year fam.;;Does anyone know if shark breeder has his own batch or sells others?","{upvote:10,timestamp:2023-12-26}",Reddit,0,

They are very crappy replicas and likely no better than the cheap one you can find on DHgate  The real bag is soft and flexible, this version is stiff and looks/ feels/ smells like plastic.   The real bag doesn‚Äôt have the 2 zippers on the wallet flap and doesn‚Äôt have the divider in the middle. The real bag shoulder strap is soft and almost faded looking with squared leather accents. The replica feels like stiff nylon and has rounded leather accents. The metal clips are matte on the original and glossy on the replica.   Dimensions are about the same.

I should mention that this is not a real piece and is a fantasy piece, but I personally don't care about wearing fantasies and when people ask me about them I'm usually upfront about it and tell them it's fantasy. But a trick that you can use to prevent giving away FashionReps is to tell people that you got your fantasy pieces from one of them instagram bootleggers like VandyThePink and Tswoop. The sizing isn't the best on these windbreakers as they have longer than usual arms compared to their back lengths. I suggest sizing up once from your hoodie size to get a good fit from this jacket. I got a medium since I always wear medium but it fits like a small, which I can still wear without having it look like a crop-top, but if I could get a new one, I would get a large instead. I gotta say though the details are pretty cool on this jacket, all the zippers have engraved logos.  1. **Quality of Fabric:  7** (it's normal windbreaker material, nothing special) 2. **Quality of Print:    7** 3. **Fit of Item:             6** (I got my tts Medium,size up once) 4. **1:1 ness:                 n/a** 5. **Overal:                    6.6**  („Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•(„Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•(„Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  **2) AƒÜW LOWKEY FLEX TEE** (0832 club)  [IN-HAND PICS](https://imgur.com/a/d82J6Wk)  &#x200B;  [Satellite pics from Mars](https://imgur.com/a/8xvwMUn)  &#x200B;  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=587890063834&spm=1101.1101.N.N.3cf0a93)  Size: S  I like this shirt a lot, I like how minimal the logo on the front is and I like A Cold Wall in general because they're still a lowkey brand. I wasn't able to find retail pics of this to check for how 1:1 it is or even know if the item is right, but honestly no one really knows this brand or know how to LC it so my suggestion for you is to  JusT WeAR wiTH cONfiDeNsE.

It's by far my second favorite item in my haul, Yes it is a lil pricey but trust, the quality doesn't disappoint! The embroidery is A-1and the print is solid too. it has washtags and neck tags and it even comes with a BIRTH CERTIFICATE telling you it's retail. The fabric is the softest fabric I have ever had on any t-shirt, retail or rep, the closest I can compare it to is a retail Helmut Lang t-shirt that I own but oh man oh man it is comfortable. BUY IT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY.  &#x200B;  1. **Quality of Fabric:  10** (Feels soft and nice to touch) 2. **Quality of Print:    9** (Print is Great, so Is the Embroidery) 3. **Fit of Item:             9** (it fits Fuckin amazing but make sure to size down twice) 4. **1:1 ness of Item:   9** (The placing of the embroidery is almost perfect the only things I noticed are the g on signature is not touching the V at the right top corner instead of the middle top, and the the top of the blue h on signature shouldn't go past the left handle of logo H look at imgur for comparison with ssense, but honestly I think the embroidery placing might be different for each size, and no one is even gonna have the balls to call you out bc of the quality) 5.

It is over sized just like retail so size down once if you don't want it to be huge, it will still have the drop shoulder style even if you size down once. the stitching is good but there are some lose threads around the back tag which I cut myself.The logo is aligned well on the front as well.

The fabric is not the greatest but it feels ok, it feels like a retail supreme tee imo. The print However, is very good and has lasted me through multiple washes. It says embroidered on Taobao listing but it is a screenprint and so is the retail version. I would def recommend buying this one if you don't want loud and in your face items.  &#x200B;  1. **Quality of Fabric:  6** (Average, but its not bad/scratchy material, just not as smooth as the other ones) 2. **Quality of Print:    9** (Print is Solid, I've worn and washed it multiple times, no cracks whatsoever) 3. **Fit of Item:             8** (it is a little boxy, and hasn't shrunk after wash, so if you want to size down once it shouldn't be a problem.) 4. **1:1 ness of Item:   8** (The print looks good based on comparing to Ssense pics. not so sure about the tags, but who cares about tags anyways?) 5. **Overal:                    7.75**  („Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•(„Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•(„Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  **8) DIOR T-REX SORAYAMA TEE WITH ARIZONA ICED TEA** **FLOWERS** (Amy)  [in-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/ONQxEtO)  &#x200B;  [Satellite pics from Mars](https://imgur.com/a/Gh1wj8x)  &#x200B;  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=594578725171&spm=1101.1101.N.N.905065c)  Size: S  MOST FAVORITE ITEM OUT OF THE ENTIRE HAUL! This one comes in first place based on quality, fit, speed of shipping, and everything. I love the whole Dior X Sorayama collab thing in general and will order more items from it soon for my next haul (which is already in the process). Let me Tell ya about the QUALITYYY. This fabric is so soft, when you put it on it feels like getting hugged by your favorite anime wifu. I can't describe how much I love this piece. I love it so much I don't even wanna wear it bc i'm afraid I might ruin it. The print is also very shiny and film-like which is how retail is and it also has all the tags that you can ask for. I would buy this in a heartbeat. I think Amy and Maxstreet have the same batch bc this and my Givenchy tee feel very similar.

I'm gonna link a post from another fam who showcased his pair and my initial qc post where kind repfam helped qc and state the flaws on these but honestly if anyone asks me if they are real or fake I would straight up say they're fake cuz getting these $2000 shoes for $10 is the ultimate flex itself. Unfortunately the seller only has 36 and 36.5 available at the moment so if you want to spoil your lady friend you can cop her one. As far as comfort they are .5 size smaller than my regular shoe size but I re-did the laces and loosey goosyed them and now they fit great and I don't have to tie the laces when I put them on anymore, they also don't come off when I walk.  on feet vid by  [u/ChopstixxGaming](https://www.reddit.com/user/ChopstixxGaming/):  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Repsneakers/comments/c30xtd/69\_yuan\_off\_white\_presto\_og\_on\_feet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Repsneakers/comments/c30xtd/69_yuan_off_white_presto_og_on_feet/)  my QC post ( checkout u/reechy99 's comment for flaws):  [https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/c5ca0a/i\_also\_gpd\_the\_69\_yuan\_air\_prestos/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/c5ca0a/i_also_gpd_the_69_yuan_air_prestos/)  &#x200B;  1. **Comfort:        7** 2. **shape:            7** 3. **Drip-factor:   9** 4. **1:1 ness:        7** (but who gives af for $10? lol) 5. **overall:           7.5**  („Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•(„Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•(„Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  **10) E-BOY AIRFORCE 1S TO GO WITH THE CHOKER CHAIN** (Umako)  [IN-HAND PICS](https://imgur.com/a/5p7b7hZ)  &#x200B;  [Satellite pics from Mars](https://imgur.com/a/NawphoI)  &#x200B;  [W2C](http://jyao888.x.yupoo.com/albums/9145981?uid=1)  Size: 40.5 (7.5 U.S.)  I couldn't find my size anywhere for retail so I said fuck it and ordered a pair of their reps, and surprisingly they are very comfortable, they fit and feel like my other airforce ones but for half of the price of retail after calculating the shipping fees. These look great if you're trying to look like the basic tik tok e-boy, put some chains and rings on with balck tops and bottoms and you're good to go!

This is not branded as Burberry so you 100% won't have any issues with customs. It is very slim fit almost skinny fit so if you're a thicc boy and don't skip legs, you might have to pass on these. the inside material is very soft and warm and good for cold weather. The length is short as well to get a cropped look that way you can show off some ankle and make the ladies go crazy. The fabric is very stretch and if you are thicc the print becomes a lil faded when the pants are on due to the stretchyness of the fabric but once its not stretched the print goes back to it's natural non faded colors.

"Adidas,H&M","quality,price,haul,popular","HAUL - AJ1 TS Olive / NB 9060 / Unbranded pants / NB and Represent shirts / Adilette slide / Yeezy foam runner and a bunch of other things ... First thing first thanks to PandaBuy! Second thing, my stats are 1,82cm 85kg 42,5 EU.  If I see that ppl show interest to this post, I'll post pictures of me wearing the clothes.  W2C + Review (by ChatGPT) :  [Air Jordan 1 Travis Scott Olive new VT batch ](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=5943804175&spider_token=4572):  While the size is a bit too big for me, the quality of these Air Jordan 1s is absolutely outstanding. The attention to detail and craftsmanship in this VT batch is on par with the best in the market. I'm glad I chose this batch over overpriced FK or PK because it truly lives up to the hype! Bought it 149¬• during sales.  [New Balance 9060 Ivory Cream TOP batch  ](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6335548386&spider_token=4572):   I was lucky enough to win these shoes in a giveaway from 001Sports, and let me tell you, they are exceptional. The TOP batch really lives up to its name. The attention to detail, the comfort, and the overall design are all top-notch. My wife absolutely loves them, and the true-to-size fit ensures her a comfortable wearing experience. Shout out to 001Sports, really nice seller btw  [New Balance shirt](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6321364387&spider_token=4572) :   When it comes to quality, this New Balance shirt doesn't disappoint. The fabric is not only durable but also feels great against the skin. I opted for an XL size, and it fits me perfectly with an intentional oversized look. I'm genuinely impressed with the craftsmanship and attention to detail. I just wish they would restock their hoodies because I'd love to add one to my collection as well.  [Represent shirt](https://detail.1688.com/offer/653869022252.html) : https://detail.1688.com/offer/653869022252.html  The quality of this Represent shirt is truly noteworthy. The fabric is lightweight, making it an ideal choice for hot summer days. I opted for a size L for my wife, which fits her perfectly with a relaxed, oversized look.   [Carhartt Patta bag](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=601195238287) :   This Carhartt Patta bag is an absolute banger! The quality of this bag is impeccable, from the sturdy construction to the high-quality zipper and precise stitching. It's clear that attention to detail was a top priority during its manufacturing. The bag is not only stylish but also highly functional, providing ample space for all your essentials. If you're in the market for a reliable and (really) CHEAP bag, look no further‚Äîthis one is a winner!   [Yeezy Foam Runner (Bone White](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4399149310&spider_token=4572)) :   I decided to size up twice (44 EU) for these Yeezy Foam Runners, and while they are incredibly comfortable, they do hit the ankle slightly. However, with a little bit of heat application, I believe I can reshape them to fit perfectly. The foam material feels plush, and despite the minor fit issue, these shoes are an absolute joy to wear.  [Adilette slides](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6158265038&spider_token=4572) :   These Adilette slides are not only true to size but also incredibly comfortable. The cushioning provides excellent support, making them perfect for casual walks or lounging around. The design is sleek, and they closely resemble retail slides. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  [Unbranded Pant](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=572073658709) :  These unbranded pants are a real game-changer for me, especially during the summer months. The level of comfort they offer is exceptional, and the 4XL size fits me perfectly. The lightweight fabric allows for optimal breathability, and the relaxed fit adds a touch of casual elegance to my outfits. It's amazing how these pants, at just 5‚Ç¨, outshine similar options found in popular retail stores like H&M. But I don't think it will last long ...   [Unbranded pants](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=643505449820) :  Comfy pants in size 4XL. Can't go wrong with these. Give your stats to the seller and he'll help you with the size like he did with me  [Unbranded pants](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=621969234532) :  Basic pants in size 38. The yellow logo may come off easily, they're decent overall.   [Celine hat]( https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=717415521339) :  I can't sing enough praises for this Celine hat. The quality is truly exceptional, and I've already purchased it twice‚Äîmy wife simply couldn't resist taking the navy blue one. The hat adds a touch of sophistication to any outfit, and it's incredibly versatile. Whether you're going for a casual or more elegant look, this Celine hat effortlessly elevates your style.  [Boost soles](https://detail.1688.com/offer/648386372559.html) :   If you're dealing with shoes that are slightly too big, these Boost soles are a game-changer. The thickness of the soles ensures a perfect fit, providing additional comfort and support. I highly recommend them if you want to optimize the sizing of your shoes.  [Adidas Socks](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=618870266960) :  For summer, these Adidas socks are exactly what I needed. They are thin and breathable, making them ideal for hot weather. Despite their lightweight feel, they still provide a comfortable and snug fit. If you're looking for summer socks, these are a solid choice. But you better cut your dragon nails before wearing it.  [Carhartt socks](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=653734124147) :  These Carhartt socks are a standout in terms of thickness and quality. The material feels sturdy, and the socks offer excellent cushioning. While I initially expected the green color to be darker, the slight shine adds a unique touch to them, but it won't fit with my AJ1. Overall, they are well-made socks that provide both comfort and durability.  [Bape socks](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=664321620714) :  These Bape socks are incredibly thick, which makes them perfect for winter or colder seasons. The level of insulation and comfort they offer is truly impressive. I'd highly recommend saving them for the chilly months when you need that extra warmth.  [Badge stone island](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=680197656124) :  While I don't know much about this particular Stone Island badge, I decided to use it to rebrand an H&M cargo, to give it a personalized touch. It's a fun way to make a rep yourself !!  [Shoe tree](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=36627603163) :   Basic shoe tree.;;Also nice items btw","{upvote:2,timestamp:2023-07-18}",Reddit,1,1

"Gucci,Adidas,Lululemon,Chanel,Ralph Lauren,Under Armour","quality,price,haul","10+ KG Haul to the Netherlands First haul review in this sub, even though I'm already reaching the 100 KG total of shipped items. Unsure how to format this, so just bear with me and enjoy the ride. Most items will have the W2C in the QC pics album(s). I've not included all items since I forgot to take pictures of some.  # Shipping  I used Basetao for this haul since they are objectively the best agent out there. I used FedEx to ship my haul, which resulted in a shipping price of 1162Y, after getting a volumetric weight of 12,5 KG. I created the parcel on 30-06-2021, and received it on 12-07-2021.  # Items  Items are in non-specific order:  # Gucci Denim Jacket  Price: ¬• 99  Rating: 9.9/10  [In-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/ABCulgR) | [QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/WmZj9zs)  I've seen this item for the first time over at LYFactory, and it was **way above my price limit**. I then later found this one on Tao for just a fraction of the price, and I knew I had to get it. The denim feels of proper quality, it has an amazing wash/color. The embroidery all feels sturdy and the little details on the teeth of the skull are amazing too. Compared to the 1188 Y version that LYFactory has, this one does not have the inner lining, which I definitely do not mind. Definitely my favorite piece of the haul!  # Chanel sweater  Price: ¬• 29,90  Rating: 8/10  [In-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/7eX3J3d) | [QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/ZHX6JPX)  I was browsing one of my regular Weidian stores and saw this on the front page. I was looking for adding some Chanel to my wardrobe and this is right up my alley. For ¬•30 you can't really go wrong. Was expecting something really shitty, but I'm pleasantly surprised! It feels a bit like it's even proper wool, since the fabric feels a bit itchy.  # Travis Scott x Air Jordan 6 T-shirt  Price: ¬• Free  Rating: 7/10  [In-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/ehDPUCz) | [QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/83aqgBx) | [W2C](https://pikachushop.x.yupoo.com/albums/96023338?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=3524014)  One of the two items that I won in the giveaways hosted in the Fashionreps discord. Initially, I didn't quite know if I would be able to pull this off, but I think I've got some ideas. The shirt itself feels nice, not like a thin budget blank. My only gripe is that there were a bunch of loose threads on it, but that's nothing major.  # Lululemon workout shorts  Price: ¬• 65 each  Rating: 8/10  [In-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/WQlbt5t) | [Black QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/jI1Uhff) | [Green QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/eSs65Zq)  Bought two of these since I was in dire need of gym clothing. Got black and green. They are very comfortable and the inner shorts are not hurting or pinching off my blood flow to my legs. I really like the inner pocket as well for putting your phone/keys etc so they don't flop out of your normal outer pockets.  # Yeezy 350 Sesame Grey  Price: ¬• 135  Rating: 7/10  [In-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/beuK00C) | [QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/haOV3os)  Got this budget pair of Yeezers for my cousin, as he wanted me to order shoes for him. According to the seller they're BASF, but I doubt it for the price. They look good to me, they feel comfortable and the boost looks good too.  # Ralph Lauren Hoodie  Price: ¬• Free  Rating: 9/10  [In-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/qEIHdoi) | [QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/A1Jxo0p) | [W2C](https://hansolo1.x.yupoo.com/albums/97395626?uid=1)  This is the second item I won in a Discord giveaway. The fabric is SUPER soft and the logo looks amazing. My girlfriend has already announced that she will be stealing it, so buy this at your own risk! I'm very thrilled for this hoodie and I picked purple to challenge myself into using this color more in my outfits.  # Under Armour Compression Workout Shorts  Price: ¬• 68 each  Rating: 7/10  [In-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/IEqvns5) | [Black QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/5ggpCxd) | [Green QC Pics](https://imgur.com/a/KHu702x) | [Gray QC Pics](https://imgur.com/a/0Vg84W3)  Got three pairs of these as they were mad cheap and I needed gym shorts. The inner pants of these shorts are tighter than the Lulu shorts, but still comfortable. The downside with these shorts is that when you have something heavy like a phone or a bunch of keys in them, the pocket will dip from under the ""outer"" shorts, and fling around while you're walking.  Black not included in the in-hand pictures because I've already worn those to the gym so they're in the laundry.  # Balenciaga Free Your Mind T-Shirt  Price: ¬• 119  Rating: 8/10  [In-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/ZSUdrzd) | [QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/iuHeLtM)  This is my first Balenciaga piece ever and I love it. It's got that nice ""edgy"" vibe to it, I absolutely love the graphic on the front. The print quality feels good, even for a budget. I was going to get a cheaper one from a different seller, but I noticed that that one did not have the ""wear and tear"" that this one had (the little holes etc). It was definitely worth the upgrade. Great blank, very comfortable.  # Chunky Dunky  Price: ¬• 280  Rating: 9/10  [In-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/ssBCc0o) | [QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/1vgPzUy)  My cousin loved these when I got them, so he insisted on getting these. He did opt for the more expensive version with better materials, because he wants them to last a bit longer. I've compared these to my 79Y chunkies and they look much better. The colors are brighter, the cowhide patterns are better, and the overall quality feels better too. The only thing they still can't fix apparently is that slogan in the tongue. I personally prefer it this way over the correct spelling though.  # Dr Martens 1461  Price: ¬• 89  Rating: 6/10  [In-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/pV1ExUv) | [QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/1GqRDCb)  I've been eyeing these because I want to try out how they are for me and how they work for my fits. Didn't want to spend a lot on them, so when I found these for 89Y I figured ""Why not?"". The back feels a bit rough so I hope it won't tear open my heel by rubbing, but we'll see.  # Goyard Passport Holder  Price: ¬• 70  Rating: 7/10  [In-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/kGqofxJ) | [QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/P8gfS6u)  I wanted a holder where I could put my passport and creditcard, so I got this. I first thought when I ordered light blue, that I would get a darker one since I had a different one in mind from the pictures on the page. Oh well. It's nice and bright, which I like. Leather feels of good quality, and it's detailed nicely. Can't complain for the price.  # Ray-Ban Sunglasses  Price: ¬• 90  Rating: 9/10  [In-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/poHDtc2) | [QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/CBgsSAY)  Wanted some nice cheap shades and didn't feel like bothering with Markin or Aooko and such. Found these on one of my trusted Weidian stores, they looked great for the price, so I just got them. They feel nice and sturdy, all the details are there and even the cloth has branding. Great find and very happy with it!  # Yeezy 350v2 Linen  Price: ¬• 136  Rating: 8/10  [In-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/LhQeSvX) | [QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/KYkrukk)  I've been eyeing yeezies for a long time, and I finally found a CW I really liked. Just like the abovementioned pair for my cousin, these are supposedly BASF but I wouldn't know. I've heard on discord that the shape is a bit off. I can't see anything wrong with it, so I'm happy with it. They are extremely comfortable too.  # Adidas TRESC Run shoes  Price: ¬• 258  Rating: 8/10  [In-hand pics](https://imgur.com/a/dQpjtwv) | [QC pics](https://imgur.com/a/BMi8Fc6)  I promised my girlfriend I'd get her some proper workout shoes, and she told me she wanted these. She mainly does cardio, so these are perfect for the treadmill. She's very happy with them and thinks they are very comfortable. The seller did send the wrong size, but we kept the shoe anyway since my girlfriend couldn't wait for them to arrive. They still fit well.

[Yeezy Foam Runner (Bone White](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4399149310&spider_token=4572)) :   I decided to size up twice (44 EU) for these Yeezy Foam Runners, and while they are incredibly comfortable, they do hit the ankle slightly. However, with a little bit of heat application, I believe I can reshape them to fit perfectly. The foam material feels plush, and despite the minor fit issue, these shoes are an absolute joy to wear.  [Adilette slides](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6158265038&spider_token=4572) :   These Adilette slides are not only true to size but also incredibly comfortable. The cushioning provides excellent support, making them perfect for casual walks or lounging around. The design is sleek, and they closely resemble retail slides. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  [Unbranded Pant](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=572073658709) :  These unbranded pants are a real game-changer for me, especially during the summer months. The level of comfort they offer is exceptional, and the 4XL size fits me perfectly. The lightweight fabric allows for optimal breathability, and the relaxed fit adds a touch of casual elegance to my outfits. It's amazing how these pants, at just 5‚Ç¨, outshine similar options found in popular retail stores like H&M. But I don't think it will last long ...   [Unbranded pants](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=643505449820) :  Comfy pants in size 4XL. Can't go wrong with these. Give your stats to the seller and he'll help you with the size like he did with me  [Unbranded pants](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=621969234532) :  Basic pants in size 38. The yellow logo may come off easily, they're decent overall.   [Celine hat]( https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=717415521339) :  I can't sing enough praises for this Celine hat. The quality is truly exceptional, and I've already purchased it twice‚Äîmy wife simply couldn't resist taking the navy blue one. The hat adds a touch of sophistication to any outfit, and it's incredibly versatile. Whether you're going for a casual or more elegant look, this Celine hat effortlessly elevates your style.  [Boost soles](https://detail.1688.com/offer/648386372559.html) :   If you're dealing with shoes that are slightly too big, these Boost soles are a game-changer. The thickness of the soles ensures a perfect fit, providing additional comfort and support. I highly recommend them if you want to optimize the sizing of your shoes.  [Adidas Socks](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=618870266960) :  For summer, these Adidas socks are exactly what I needed. They are thin and breathable, making them ideal for hot weather. Despite their lightweight feel, they still provide a comfortable and snug fit. If you're looking for summer socks, these are a solid choice. But you better cut your dragon nails before wearing it.  [Carhartt socks](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=653734124147) :  These Carhartt socks are a standout in terms of thickness and quality. The material feels sturdy, and the socks offer excellent cushioning. While I initially expected the green color to be darker, the slight shine adds a unique touch to them, but it won't fit with my AJ1. Overall, they are well-made socks that provide both comfort and durability.  [Bape socks](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=664321620714) :  These Bape socks are incredibly thick, which makes them perfect for winter or colder seasons. The level of insulation and comfort they offer is truly impressive. I'd highly recommend saving them for the chilly months when you need that extra warmth.  [Badge stone island](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=680197656124) :  While I don't know much about this particular Stone Island badge, I decided to use it to rebrand an H&M cargo, to give it a personalized touch.

Although I think it is wonderful to see brands moving towards sustainability, this collection will actually impact the way Nike is producing shoes? or it is just a way to leverage the sustainability trend?   Let's be honest, the major problem in fashion is not the sneakerhead or the sneakers collectors, they preserve and resell sneakers giving them a potentially endless life. While normal consumers (the majority of shoes consumers), the ones that buy shoes for 40$ at Nike outlet or similar, unconsciously use sneakers sometimes without cleaning then, they go to a party, and the shoes are already destroyed and ready to be wasted. They are the fast consuming problem of fashion. So, if Nike uses sustainable production only on hype sneakers, is it really making fashion more sustainable?;;This sort of thing from nike isn't really a marketing strategy, it's more of an engineering exercise that they can take forward if they want to.","{upvote:2,timestamp:2020-06-02}",Reddit,0,

"Chanel,Versace",quality,"I ordered 3 bottles of Cologne from the Perfume Guy (100$+) This post probably won't be the most detailed but thought I would leave a review to help other people decide if they want to order from him.   General:  I ordered on December 7th from the West Coast US and received my order on the 26th which was pretty expected. The package was way smaller than I expected but I did order plastic bottles and I assume they are smaller than the glass bottles. Once opened the package was very slimy and oily with bubble wrap surrounding the cologne, so I assume the person who packed my order had cologne oil all over their hands or something leaked. Overall the bottles were decent and sprayed as the average cologne bottle would.  So my order consisted of:  Bleu De Chanel 1.2oz I believe  Creed Aventus 2oz  Eros Versace Flame 2oz  The Bleu De Chanel was a 1:2 consistency and smelt great but was extremely strong when first putting it on but after around 1 hour it smelt great.  Creed Aventus was very odd since I heard extreme hype over it in the cologne world but smelt very off to me, I regret ordering it in a 1:2 consistency as this is way too strong and overpowering but the cologne itself isn't great. Very off-putting that people spend 300$ on the real version of this (3.4 ounce bottle) but maybe something was just off with my order  Eros Versace Flame was 1:2 consistency like my whole order and just doesn't smell that good, I am not trained at finding the scent a cologne puts off but if I had to compare it, it smells a lot like Polo Red but more cinnamony if that makes any sense.   I would give the perfume guy a 7.5/10 on the order and I probably messed it up by ordering in such a high concentration rate but the cologne smelt like good quality stuff.

"Louis Vuitton,LV,Gucci,Prada",quality,"Review of prescription glasses from AOOKO. Louis Vuitton and Gucci frames. Hi everyone, I recently got some prescription sunglasses to replace my retail Prada's that have served me well the past 5 years... so I ordered these direct from Aooko. Here goes:  A little about myself first off:  I'm a 39 y/o dude, 5'10"", around 185-190 lb... hair has seen better days, so watch out on the selfie pics.  I placed my order over WhatsApp. I hit him up on 11/18 and he got back to me within a few hours. Gave him my prescription script and two pairs of glasses I saw from his Yupoo page. I picked out a set of [Gucci frames](https://imgur.com/8LaydMr)  and [Louis Vuitton aviators](https://imgur.com/DVWPfBD) which I really liked. He told me they were $50 a frame plus $46 for lenses and $6 each for shipping. He later updated it once he looked at my prescription and said it was $70 for the lenses, polarized. All in total it was $246 including shipping, which... truth be told... was cheaper than me trying to get my retail Gucci frames outfitted with lenses without insurance from my optometrist. I think they quoted me at over $300. Costco used to do prescription sunglasses but apparently not anymore. Could be my local store, but that's where I used to go to get my lenses done on the cheap.  Back to the story, I paid him on the 19th via Paypal (friends and family) and he reconfirmed all my info on the 20th. The aviators were available in a bunch of colors and asked for my preferences, etc. He told me it would take a few weeks but he would give me QC photos before they shipped out and would give me tracking numbers. The aviators were finished first and went out on 12/3. He realized that he forgot to give me QC photos on those, but was able to get me the QC photos on the Gucci frames which were set to be shipped the next day.  The Aviators shipped out on 12/3, and got to my door on 12/16. The Gucci frames went out on the 12/7 and got to my door in NJ on 12/21. Ironically, the majority of the time, it was sitting in customs at JFK. Both packages arrived really well packed, but I didn't take any photos of the boxes. It was a nice change of pace dealing with reps... having to spend over $100 for shipping and this that and the other thing.  The aviators arrived in [this box](https://imgur.com/KwWnnPa). I was a bit disappointed they didn't come with any retail boxes, or something resembling a retail box, but in retrospect, it's probably so they go through customs easier and I don't need to worry as much leaving them in my car in the box. That being said, the aviators have some serious weight! Here's a photo of them ([photo in grams](https://imgur.com/UGIIyrb)) ([photo in ounces](https://imgur.com/MM7eALc)) next to my regular glasses ([in grams](https://imgur.com/aagSG6C)) ([in ounces](https://imgur.com/n1NzoKp)), which are retail Tom Ford's I got from Gilt a few years ago. Heres a few more shots of the frames.  [side label](https://imgur.com/V3T7EDv)  [side in box](https://imgur.com/OXQ5sJ3)  [front on box](https://imgur.com/7IloVpy)  [gratuitous bathroom selfie](https://imgur.com/EVtD3xN)  [gratuitous bathroom selfie 2](https://imgur.com/yBtFTjo)  They're solid all around, and the details seem pretty good to me. They even have the branding on the [nose pads](https://imgur.com/KCGKa9O).  I showed them to a co-worker that has some retail LV stuff and he was surprised at the quality. He said he wouldn't have known they were replicas had I not told him.  The [Gucci frames](https://imgur.com/igdm9lj), arrived in another similar [generic box](https://imgur.com/q7gSGPa). My wife called it a granny frames box. I haven't held the retail frames, so I can't speak to how it feels but they're not as solid. They're built pretty decently, but comparing them to my retail Prada's that I've had for a few years, the Prada's have a bit more heft to them. The arms on the Gucci frames are a bit flexible, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I'm hoping they'll last. My Prada frames I have are an acetate style frame and the arms don't really budge when you flex them. Considering the measurements were the same as my last frames, they seem to hug the side of my head more than my last ones.  That being said, I still feel like I've gotten my money's worth with them. With both of the frames to be honest. They each came with a little business card verifying prescription and I even took both of them to my optometrist to have them tested when my regular frames came in. They were surprised by the quality, verified the prescription and said they were fine. If I had a favorite, it would definitely be the aviators. I'd highly recommend them to anyone looking to get them.

This jacket was first popularized by Kayne back in the day and ASAP rocky as well. The construction of the jacket is very good, its high quality velvet and overall has a good weight to it that makes it feel very high quality. Highly recommend this jacket.  **Haider Ackermann Green Velvet Jacket // 899 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-15056609773.26.4d3e2062woPDqu&id=658437816121) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/TO01JH6)  Size: M // Color: Green  Looks: 10/10 // Feel: 9/10 // Overall: 9/10  Thoughts: Another Haider jacket that is absolutely beautiful. I love haiders work and his jackets, they just give off such an air of luxury. This jacket is gorgeous with it being a VERY dark green, almost black at first glance. Highly recommend, the way the colors move on this jacket is wild. It looks incredible on person, with the drapey shoulders and the oversized lazy luxury look. Im docking points due to the shoulders on mine standing up more than the retail photos, as in they are rather pointy when it should be droopy. Not a big deal as you can just press them down in person, but I will point out the flaw anyways.  **A.A. Spectrum Cyberen Jacket // 2999 yuan //** Original link sold out, found one for only 2390 yuan  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.128.201d380aKeEShC&id=662937201448&ns=1&abbucket=17#detail) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/eItTQfJ)  Size: M // Color: Silver Grey  Looks: 10/10 // Feel: 10/10 // Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: This jacket is not actually a replica, this is a legitimate designer brand in China. I saw the jacket on some instagram post and fell in love with it, its so beautiful, nice oversized construction, very warm and goose down filled. The stitching is immaculate on this jacket and it looks fantastic as a layering piece. The color is super nice and it has a slight metallic sheen to it. If anyone is on the fence, I highly recommend this piece, its one of my current favorites. It goes so well with a lot of things and overall an excellent statement piece.  **Gremade Homme Grey Suede jacket // 2300 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=602691368075) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/CNipVI3)  Size: L // Color: Grey  Looks: 10/10 // Feel: 10/10 // Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Beautiful suede trucker jacket in grey from my seller MadeByGu, this guy consistently makes high quality basics and I love his work. This jacket comes with his own tags but is absolutely stunning, I believe its made out of a goats leather, it is so smooth and soft to the touch. I absolutely love leather and suede jackets and this one is an amazing color. Rather pricey, but so is leather I guess. Highly recommend if you're looking for high quality basics.  **Hyein Seo Bomber Jacket // 629 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=630534304930&spm=1101.1101.N.N.c805155) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/GrPTdGT)  Size: 2 // Color: Brownish  Looks 9/10 // Feel: 10/10 Overall:9/10  Thoughts: This jacket I kinda bought on a whim when I saw it posted and its a very well made jacket. The jacket comes with a hood that I think is ugly and takes away from the jacket but is removable, leaving a very nice bomber underneath. The bomber is high quality and thick, and seems very warm. The color is beautiful, with the main brownish color being a slight metallic, and has a nice sheen when you look at it. Overall very good for the price, highly recommend.  I will however be selling this jacket as its not really my style and I just kind of impulse purchased it.  **Bottega Vanetta Wool Jacket // 998 yuan //**  [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4439077735&spider_token=4572&spm=1101.1101.N.N.27dfa93) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/4wc2E9s)  Size: M // Color: Black  Looks: 10/10 Feels:8/10 Overall: 8/10  Thoughts: This is the BV jacket from Kappler, so you know its high quality. Overall the jacket is very well made, with high quality thick wool. I am docking marks as the jacket is a little scratchy, and not that comfortable to wear for the price. Overall its well made, it is very cropped and goes very well as a plain basic jacket, with a very subtle flex for those that recognize it. The jacket itself is rather cropped but overall nice. Good looks, not that comfy to wear.  **Rough Simmons Bomber Jacket // 649 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=659706725969&spm=1101.1101.N.N.4879c7d) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/izBRxY3)  Size: M // Color: Green  Looks:9/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Ironically, this is a replica of a replica jacket lol. This jacket was made as a meme for the rough simmons brand, to create a replica of his RIOT bomber, and this is a replica of that jacket hahahahaha. Overall the construction on the bomber is really well made, its ridiculously thick and warm and well made and overall I highly recommend it. Very comfy and the inside is soft to the touch. Outside seems to be made of a denim-ish material.  **Haider Ackermann Silk Floral Bomber // 699 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=629433568294&spm=1101.1101.N.N.92b6f69) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/bj8NbRg)  Size: M // Color: Red  Looks: 9/10 Feels: 8/10 Overall:8.5/10  Thoughts: This jacket is high quality, very silky and looks like retail I believe, with a similar cut. So very drapey very loose. The jacket itself seems rather thin however, but its possible retail is like that, I am not sure. I am docking marks overall for being a thin jacket, but other than that, its a good jacket. Soft and silky to the touch, its a pretty nice statement piece that I would recommend.  **Deeds Leather Bomber jacket // 3788 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=659504376629&spm=1101.1101.N.N.cf85edb) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/QqVSzRr)  Size: M // Color: Black  Looks: 10/10 Feels: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Ok I will not lie, this piece was crazy expensive, but its insanely high quality and very well made. This seller consistently makes good quality stuff and this jacket is no different. Its a blend of goat and sheep leather I believe and has a very nice texture to it. From afar it looks rather like a nylon bomber, like a typical bomber, but up close you can see that it is actually a very nice leather. Overall ridiculously nice quality, also a ridiculous price point. If you have the money, I do recommend the jacket, its VERY nice.  **ALYX Puffer jacket // 940 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=660074953160&spm=1101.1101.N.N.6cc6e84) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/QIkPIxP)  Size: M // Color: Black  Looks: 10/10 Feels: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Again this jacket was bought on an impulse and I realize that I have wayyy too many jackets that I have no way of wearing. This jacket is very thick and warm overall and very well made. The alyx buckle on the neck seems well made and wont come loose or anything. I havent worn it outside but seems very warm and high quality. I will be selling this piece so take a look at my BST if you want to buy it. Overall I do recommend this jacket as it is very thick and warm.  **MKSZY Green Raccoon Bomber // 899 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=609889706454&spm=1101.1101.N.N.e54f0a1) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/GxQELJf)  Size: S // Color: Green  Looks:10/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: This jacket comes in a beautiful army green color that is pre-distressed and looks incredible in my opinion. It gives it a nice rain stained or like weathered look that I think pairs beautifully with the color. The bomber itself is lined with raccoon fur or at least that's what the post says. I believe the jacket is on a major discount as the seller is trying to get rid of old stock. The inside fur feels very high quality and soft to the touch and seems like a very warm jacket over. For the pricepoint, I think its an absolute steal. 10/10 recommend.  **Haider Ackermann Silk Bomber // 749 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-14467898476.35.4a101d2aGqNRu4&id=629580703961) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/Xr30vWm)  Size: M // Color: Black  Looks: 10/10 Feels: 9/10 Overall: 9/10  Thoughts: This jacket is significantly thicker than the red one that was posted earlier which is why I am rating it higher. Overall it is very high quality silk, or something very close to silk. It feels incredible to touch, it drapes well, this is an excellent jacket and I highly recommend it. I took some marks off of feel as the shoulders feel rather tight for the jacket, but I suppose that could just be me getting unlucky with QCs.  **Kapital Fleece Jacket // 388 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=638414231090&spm=1101.1101.N.N.aaa1d50) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/UGHJNRO)  Size: M // Color: Khaki  Looks 9/10 Feels:8/10 Overall: 8/10  Thoughts: Its a fleece jacket, relatively simple and warm to wear. I am docking points as the fleece doesn't seem to be the highest quality overall, but that is to be expected from a cheaper rep I suppose. Nice jacket, pretty warm, has some padding so you can wear it in colder temps. Nice if you want a fleece jacket, but dont get your hopes up on some insane quality.  üëï **Tees/Long Sleeves/Sweaters/Crewnecks/Hoodies** üëï  **Undercover X Sacai Crewneck // 249 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-15816346795.53.6f372930BZT6iH&id=560604842969) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/bTxyok7)  Size: 5 // Color: Black  Looks:10/10 Feels:9/10 Overall 9/10  Thoughts: Nice and basic crewneck, I docked points as the sweater is fleece on the inside and I heavily prefer french terry inside. Although that is my subjective opinion so dont look too far into it. This store has a lot of nice undercover stuff if you were looking for some tees or hoodies or whatnot. Overall a nice basic crewneck, nothing much to say here. Good for the price  **Raf Denim Shirt // 259 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=631335926387&spm=1101.1101.N.N.f1f855c) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/GM7nCat)  Size: S // Color: Black  Looks 10/10 Feels:8/10 Overall: 9/10  Thoughts: I have absolutely 0 idea of the accuracy of this shirt. I bought it simply for the logo on the  shirt. Nothing too crazy to speak of, the shirt is average quality. Nothing special for the price. If youre looking for a raf shirt go for it but I am unsure of the accuracy on it.  **Saint Laurent Sail Shirt // 398 yuan**  [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4422997976&spider_token=4572&spm=1101.1101.N.N.d738edc) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/1qYIj65)  Size: S // Color: Black  Looks:10/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Another piece by Kappler, this shirt is also crazy nice. Its made of this soft and smooth viscose which feels super luxury and high quality. The shirt is relatively cropped however so do note that, but otherwise this shirt is crazy nice. Super nice summer piece, also great as a layering piece. Kappler doesnt miss. highly recommend.  üëñ Pants üëñ  **Rick Owens Bauhaus Cargos**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=612572113595&spm=1101.1101.N.N.21b1f77) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/Uu8Uiqq)  Size:48 // Color: Black  Looks:9/10 Feels:9/10 Overall: 9/10  Thoughts: Overall people comment that Pink Elephants drawstrings are too beige and nothing like retail, but when I compare the drawstrings to my retail pair, they seem very similar. I dont think it would ever be possible to call out in person. Overall nice pants, I havent touched retail so I cant comment on accuracy but these are not crazy comfy. The cotton is rather thick and scratchy but im unsure if retail is like that too. Either way probably the best reps were gonna get so I recommend.  üíé Accessories/Other üíé  **David Studio Chrome Hearts earrings // 180 yuan - 240 yuan**  [W2C](https://m.intl.taobao.com/detail/detail.html?id=638715576548&spm=1101.1101.N.N.63e008a) \+ [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=643376318749&spm=1101.1101.N.N.a046c87) \+ [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=575146719724&spm=1101.1101.N.N.615967b) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/S5bfOPt)  Looks:10/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: David Studios Chrome hearts, reviewed to death. High quality silver, none of his pieces have turned any of my skin green. Overall high quality big recommend.  **Raf Tote Bag // 238 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=638932550566&spm=1101.1101.N.N.c557d16) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/pfDBNee)  Looks:10/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: unsure of accuracy, I just wanted a tote bag to carry around. Comes with a very nice vintage feel to it already, overall nice back. Not long enough for cross body but goes over the shoulder well.  **Issey Miyake Pleated Bag // 138 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-19751379310.10.35e45b3bL7DyuW&id=607051369806) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/SBu9AE6)  Looks:10/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Same deal as the raf bag, Im unsure of accuracy, I just wanted a nice bag. This bag seems relatively high quality, with the pleats being pretty pronounced and solid. Very good bag for the price, imo this is a pickup if you want a nice bag.  üëü Shoes üëü  **Jiaofu's DIOR navigate boots // 1480 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-23295003257.19.44e545b4R3yYr5&id=660797450437) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/kNj2nnG)  Looks:10/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: So I preordered these a longggg time ago and with the preorder price, I ended up only paying 1100 yuan. Overall these are a phenomenal pair of combat boots, I believe he got the silhouette right on these and they look incredible on foot. Very nice winter wear and I am sure glad that I purchased them. Highly recommend if youre looking for a nice pair of combat boots. He also produces the shoe in patent leather and in pebble leather but Im not sure how many sizes he has left.  **Balenciaga X-pander // 780 yuan**  Dead link but these are all over weidian, just pick the cheapest link or look at Jin or Bean // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/7DMiOZ8)  Looks: 9/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Ok so Im pretty sure theres only one batch of these right now anyways, so just pick the cheapest link that you can find. The shoe overall is very well made, with each shoe having a surprising weight to them. Theyre actually really comfy to walk in ive found and I did not need to break them in at all. They do feel weird sometimes though, kinda like walking in short high heels. Nothing that you cant get used to however. Very nice pair of shoes, highly recommend if youre looking for something diffferent. These look best with loose pants i will say.  **Guidi PL2 // 988 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=578789639171&spm=1101.1101.N.N.fbc8059) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/4i5mHW1)  Size: 43 // Color: Black  Looks:10/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: The folks over at Qreps say that this is horse leather and when comparing to my retail pair of 986s, it seems like it could be horse leather. Overall the shoes are well constructed, I really liked the aesthetics on them so I got a pair. Compared to retail however, the shaft is looser for sure. Not an issue on foot but just something to keep an eye out for. Additionally, the leather comes with a weird sheen on it but once you rub some leather polish on it, it looks just like retail. Overall, execellent boots for the price in my opinion and I recommend them.  **Amiri Desert Combat Boots // 398 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=626495137087&spm=1101.1101.N.N.9ce14ba) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/sNOkVlZ)  Size: 43 // Color: Desert 1  Looks:10/10 Feels: 9/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: I honestly had really low expectations going into this, like cmon what kind of boot for 80 cad is going to be good? But actually these boots were pleasantly surprising. They are pretty high quality, with no glue stains or poor stitching anywhere and they seem to hold up well to the outdoors. I havent taken them out into like crazy snow due to the seude on them but they seem to hold up well as combat boots! Absolutely unbeatable for the price and I highly recommend. I docked a point for comfort as they are a bitch to lace up and they arent CRAZY comfy, but for 80$? who can complain.  **Bottega Vanetta Lug Sole Boots // 250 cad shipped**  [W2C](https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/796073661/mens-womens-leather-italian-calfskin?click_key=c3f8f12c63ab54da710295592315cf229a57289c%3A796073661&click_sum=f393e23f&ref=shop_home_active_59&frs=1&crt=1) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/Z22IefE)  Size: 42 // Color: Normal Black  Looks:10/10 Feels: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Apologies for the poor photos. I realize that I didnt have any real photos of the product alone so I had to use my comparison pics to my retail pair from a while ago. For reference the reps are the pair on the right, with the shinier leather. The boots themselves are fantastic quality, being very similar to retail ive noticed with the only exceptions being the shinier leather and a slightly looser shaft. Not an issue on foot as it is unnoticable. Overall incredible reps for only 1/8 the retail cost. Highly recommend this seller. Took him a while to ship out, but once he actually shipped it out, it was like UPS priority, only took like 1.5 days to get to my doorstep.  &#x200B;  **TECHWEAR**  **ACG 2 in 1 jacket // 1550 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=577099236975&spm=1101.1101.N.N.ade196) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/Oimrs8w)  Size: S // Color: Black  Looks:10/10 Feels: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Honestly if I could rebuy the jacket in a size larger I would, but unfortunately it is what is it. The size chart isnt crazy accurate with the chest being like 4cm off in the chest making it kinda tight. Otherwise tho, the jacket is super high quality, very warm and seem good. Recommend, but perhaps size up once based on their size charts.  **Acronym J1TS-S HD // 1320 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=564039991384&spm=1101.1101.N.N.ef43524) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/MoONYWD)  Size: M // Color: Black  Looks:10/10 Feels: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Same deal as the jacket above, super high quality jacket, perhaps a little on the thin side, but that just leaves more room for a layering techwear coat underneath. Highly recommend, this one fits the size chart correctly. I hear its not quite retail level, but Im satisfied looking at the jacket and the quality.  **Acronym J1B-GT // 968 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-18654917936.27.24645230iyXXtV&id=652257168131) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/CIqUujz)  Size: S // Color: Black  Looks:10/10 Feels: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Honestly similar to the above jackets, it just doesnt come with the Acronym branding and comes with the stores own ninjawarning tag instead. Overall the quality feels similar to the expensive batches. If you dont care about tags, buy from ninjawarning instead. Overall recommend the jacket.;;Looks really sick :D","{upvote:6,timestamp:2022-02-03}",Reddit,1,1

"Chanel,YSL","worth it,comparison","Perfume Guy Review: YSL - Y, Armani - Acqua Di Geo, Tom Ford - F**king fabulous, Chanel - bleu, Creed - Aventus # Welcome to my Perfume Guy Review. Please note, this review is completely unbias. I have no agreement with Perfume Guy to share this, I'm just doing this to share my experience and provide insight and feedback.   #### Please note, I sampled all the genuine fragrances and brought them home to compare with scent cards. Yes I know on skin and material is different.   ### Tom Ford - F**king Fabulous 30ml 1:3 Glass Bottle (4/10) This stuff literally is a chemical bomb. The alcohol content in it is so high and potent, you can't really grasp the smell until a couple of hours have passed at LEAST. When the fragrance has had a bit of time to diffuse, it keeps that element of 'older man' smell that the real thing has, but not really in the same tier. It smells fake if I'm being honest, and not really a close fake. It has that leathery-peppery smell that you'd expect, but the accuracy just isn't there. It almost smells expired. I sprayed some behind my ear before bed and the smell left on my pillow was sort of nice the next day. Would I recommend this to a group of guys who are 14-26? Absolutely not. Would I recommend this as a gift for some Uncle of yours who you could tell them it isn't genuine? Maybe.   ### Creed - Aventus  30ml 1:3 Glass Bottle (2/10) Easily the worst fragrance I got out of all 5. The chemical blast is still a huge factor with this one. It's so awful my friend and I pranked our friend with a couple of sprays on his shirt and he had to completely change and shower it was that unpleasant. I wish I was kidding. I personally couldn't find any real resemblance to the original fruity, tangy and rich smell, it just smells like chemicals you shouldn't be inhaling. I wouldn't recommend this as a gift, for yourself, or even as a joke in all honesty. I know it sounds harsh, but this is my honest opinion.   ### YSL - Y  30ml 1:3 Glass Bottle (5/10) It's bearable. It's definitely in the same ballpark in terms of smell as the genuine. I'm reading online that a lot of people pickup Apple in the genuine, which I didn't in the genuine and the replica. You definitely get the sage smell, and 'young forest' just comes to mind. The alcohol content once again is very high, but maybe the least high out of all 5. Once again, I don't think I can recommend this just because of the potency and the accuracy. It's really hard to explain through text, but the best way I can put it is; it's there, but it's not. If you wanted to buy this because you just want to try a new designer fragrance with no interest in buying the real thing and you're not wearing it to impress anyone, sure, get it. Looking to impress a girl, your friends, colleagues etc.? No. Get something genuine.   ### Armani - Acqua Di Geo  30ml 1:3 Glass Bottle (4/10) In terms of accuracy, I'd put it in the same category the Tom Ford was in. The genuine is very citrus-y smooth, very classy, very recognisable. This smells cheap and sweet from the first minute to the 8th hour. Alcohol content once again just blasts the living daylight out of your nostrils. If you know what the genuine is like and you like it, don't get this expecting the same thing. It's just not and you'll be disappointed unfortunately.   ### Chanel - Bleu  30ml 1:3 Glass Bottle (6/10) The best replica that I got out of the 5. It holds up quite well in terms of comparison to the real thing (after an hour or so of airing out of course, yes it still smells like nuclear fallout). I definitely get the sea kind of element and '25 year old chill dude' smell that the original reminds me of. It's not over the top, it's a bit on the sugary headache side, but I can't complain. Of course I can't say it's close to 1:1, but it's the closest. Maybe 0.74:1?  ------------------  I hate to say it, but if I could recommend you to pick between 1 x Genuine EDT fragrance or 5+ x Replica EDT/Parfum's, I'd strongly suggest the genuine. The biggest difference for all of them was the 'cheap' element you got. This isn't placebo either. I've worn replica clothing for years now and I've never felt 'cheap' until I tried on these fragrances. They're just not worth it. I'd literally recommend these to you if maybe if you lived on skid row and wanted to make your bando smell a bit more nice.   I'm interested in hearing any questions anyone has and would love to answer them. Let me know, and sorry Perfume Guy, this is just my opinion.;;Hey, thanks for the review. You don't have to be sorry, everybody has their opinion and its fine. I hope I change your opinion in future and you would give me another chance.","{upvote:32,timestamp:2020-01-15}",Reddit,1,1

Prada,"quality,price,aesthetic","Finally got it! Prada Waist Bag from WZ - 140 USD - Direct Shipping via FedEx Review - Prada Waist Bag from WZ - 140$ -   I recently purchased a Prada bag from a seller named WZ for the price of $140.   From the moment I placed my order, I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of the shipping. The package arrived promptly, and the seller, WZ, deserves kudos for the efficient delivery.  Also, I got the QC pictures a day after I purchased.  Now, onto the bag itself, to be very honest, its quality is truly remarkable.   The craftsmanship and attention to detail make it difficult to believe it's not an authentic Prada.   The material used is sturdy, and the stitching is impeccable. The bag exudes a premium feel, and its design closely mirrors that of the genuine Prada counterpart.  In terms of functionality, the bag‚Äôs ability to accommodate a significant amount of belongings while retaining its smaller size is truly impressive. For those who appreciate a balance between practicality and aesthetics, this aspect adds another positive dimension to the overall appeal of the bag.  Considering the amazing quality and the fast shipping, I will rate WZ‚Äôs Prada Waist bag a solid 10 out of 10, nothing went wrong, everything went smooth and clean and the bag looks hella good, so why not.  While the authenticity factor is obviously absent, the value for money and the overall craftsmanship makes it an excellent choice for those seeking a high quality imitation.

"LV,YSL",comparison,"Chez Pierre 11 perfume review Hi everyone a while ago I reviewed 5 fragrances I ordered from Chez Pierre.   This time I ordered 11 different perfumes (& some doubles) because I was super satisfied last time.   Shipping took about 2 weeks this time (including customs)  Communication was amazing like last time.    This review will be divided into 4 parts:   1. Intro 2. Review  3. Comparison to retail 4. My personal favourites   Just to be clear **I DO NOT BENEFIT FROM THIS REVIEW.** I just want to help fellow perfume fans that don‚Äôt want to spend $$$$$ on perfumes.   So that was the introduction I guess, now on to the perfumes.   1. **Aventure (= Creed Aventus)**  First of all, I don‚Äôt like the original Aventus or the CDN clone. Lots of people love it but it‚Äôs not for me.   As soon as you spray the perfume you smell citrus and pineapple. After the smell dries down it smells a little sweet, spicy, aquatic and fruity.   I really like this perfume, I actually prefer it over the original. The reasons for this are the amazing longevity and the balance in the perfume.   **Compared to retail: 7.5/10 (retail also varies a lot per batch, might differ for other retails)**  **My score: 9/10**   2. **Old Tree (= Tom Ford Oud Wood)**  First notes are woody, musky and some amber. The dry down is more leathery and powdery to me. There is a small note of vanilla noticeable.   Very nice perfume for more fancy occasions or to impress someone. It gives a fancy vibe, but not too fancy. As if you are just fancy without trying too hard.   **Compared to retail: 8/10**  **My score: 8/10 (I prefer the Magnificent aka Fucking Fabulous by TF)**   **PS: I reviewed the FF by Tom Ford in my last review. Which is pinned on my profile**   3. **Citrus Wave (= Tom Ford Madarino di Amalfi)**  As the name might tell you this is a very aquatic, citrus fragrance. I feel like this perfume is a fancier version of Cool Water by Davidoff.  This is a nice variation on a fresh summer fragrance. The opening is citrus heavy, but the dry down is more aquatic.   If you like fresh fragrances, this might be an amazing, more unique alternative to Cool Water or Light Blue.   Compared to retail: N/A  My score: 6/10 (Not my favourite, but again solid summer fragrance)   4. **Sealover (= LV Afternoon Swim)**  This summer fragrance is AMAZING! The opening is citrus, anise and salty. To me it is like a more unique version of Artisan Pure by JV.   Such an interesting fragrance, however I would not recommend this one for people inexperienced with perfumes.   It gives me fancy beach club vibes, with a white shirt on ordering a cocktail.   **Compared to retail: 8.5/10**  **My score: 9.2/10**   5. **Fiction (= TF Lost Cherry)**  Very interesting fragrance, like the original one. I prefer this one over the original, because it is less sweet in my opinion.   The opening is powdery, almond and slight hints of cherry and vanilla. Once the fragrance dries down the cherry and vanilla take the lead.   There are slight notes of spice and powdery vibes, and a little almond still  **Compared to retail: 8.8/10**  **My score: 9/10**  **NOTE:** I feel like this a fragrance you have to be able to pull off and be confident with. If you wear it right its a mind-blower.   6. **Serenity (LV l‚Äôimmensit√©)**   This fragrance is super easy to pull off. I can recommend this to everyone, very likeable fragrance overall.   Very aromatic fragrance, with aquatic, citrus and woody touches.  This fragrance reminds me of pure relaxation. As if you are having picnic on a grass field with the sun shining.   **Compared to retail: N/A**  **My score: 9.9/10**    7. **Magnificent (= TF F\*\*\*\*\*\* Fabulous)**  **I reviewed this one in my previous review, which is pinned on my profile.**   Not the easiest to pull off, very impressive if used in the right occasions and the performance is out of this world.    8. **Summer Night (= Nuit De L‚ÄôHomme YSL)**  Again a very aromatic fragrance, bit powdery and sweet. Very good date/ evening fragrance. Slightly noticeable fruit notes as well.   This perfume is relatively easy to pull off in general. Very good fragrance to get into the perfume world.   So nothing too crazy, but a safe blind buy for sure.   **Compared to retail: 9/10**  **My score: 7/10**   9. **Luxurious (LV Ombre Nomade)**   BOYS AND GIRLS WE GOT A WINNER.  This perfume blew my mind, just like the original it is such a complex, multilayered perfume.   It has amber, smoky, woody, leathery, musky notes. Just amazing, I can‚Äôt give an exact description because it is so unique.   The dry down also has hints of rose (flowery).   **Compared to retail: 9/10**   **My score 10/10**   **NOTE: if you are familiar with fragrances and like to stand out, this is then one!**  **NOTE 2:** **NOT** **AN EVERYDAY FRAGRANCE**   10. **Blanc (=TF Soleil Blanc)**   This one is my favourite summer fragrance together with the Serenity one. The fragrance is very focused on coconut and vanilla notes.   It reminds me of a good pi√±a colada on a beach. A little more unique compared to the Serenity fragrance.   I would say the Serenity is a good daily summer fragrance, the Blanc one is for the special occasions or beach parties.   **Compared to retail: 8.5/10**   **My score 9.2/10**    11. **White Horse (PDM Pegasus)**   Only smelled this one in the store before and I must say the resemblance is amazing.   The vanilla and almond notes come out strong and keep dominating the fragrance.   The fragrance is also slightly sweet and powdery.  So very close to the original. I would recommend this to people who like vanilla fragrances.   **Compared to retail: 9.510**   **My score 9/10**   **My top 3**  1. **Luxurious (Number 8)** 2. **Blanc** 3. **Fiction**  I chose these 3 because I feel they are all fitting for different occasions.

"Louis Vuitton,LV","waste,quality,haul","[Review] LV haul review (Louis Vuitton shoes and wallet) Today I received this haul of Louis Vuitton stuff and I am practically sure that I got the quality right. As you can see, there are two products, some trainers and a men's wallet.  About the sneakers: I was looking for this shoe model for a while and since it is very precious and will attract attention on the street, I decided to go for something of good quality, they come with other white laces in case you want to change them. I see all the details where they should be, the tab is fine, and with the code on the inside. The toe box is spot on and the Louis Vuitton signature looks good. I like the white detail next to the laces where it says Louis Vuitton too. Regarding the size, they are TTS, I wear a 43 and they fit me perfectly, I would say that they are more comfortable than the other Louis Vuitton trainers model.  About the wallet: from the QC photos I was already expecting something good, but nevertheless I wanted to check the stitching on the leather, the truth is that it looks uniform and the material also looks good, it doesn't look like the typical cheap material that will wear out after two months. It doesn't have a zipper to store coins so I would be grateful if you could give me any tips for coins. I always talk first with the sellers via Wechat to make sure they have stock and size, so I don't waste time.

Started in 2014, FashionReps has grown to become a leading community in the world-wide movement towards purchasing goods from China. Throughout the years there has been numerous malicious sellers who have done the community wrong which is why I'm writing this guide - to allow for a better and safer experience throughout your journey.  **In the current world environment it is important to use an agent.** Agents offer additional security when ordering from websites such as Taobao, Weidian, 1688, and even direct sellers! **PandaBuy offers unique features that no other agent offers and more importantly has great shipping prices.** This guide will go over everything you need to know to start ordering products from China as soon as today.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # II - General Info About Taobao Agents.  # 1. What is an Agent?  An agent is a middle-man service provider that allows you to purchase goods from numerous websites such as Taobao, Weidian, 1688, Yupoo, and many more. Much like how Amazon works with third party sellers, an Agent will do the same. Products will be purchased through your choice of agent (**I recommend** [**PandaBuy**](https://www.pandabuy.com/login?id=1&inviteCode=FashionReps) **due to their unique features & pricing**), sent to a warehouse, pictures taken of the product and uploaded for you to see, then shipped to you after payment.  The main website used by the community is [Taobao.com](https://taobao.com/) and [Weidian.com](https://weidian.com/). Think of it like Amazon or eBay for China - solely for China. The problem that results in is that we need to establish a connection between your country and China. This is where an Agent comes into play.  You browse through your favorite Taobao shops and find some items you want to buy. Now you do not buy it through Taobao but through your agent (in our case, PandaBuy). PandaBuy now buys this exact item and lets it deliver to their warehouse. You ask for pictures, measurements, exchanges, returns etc. When everything is fine PandaBuy will package everything and deliver it to you. They are the connection between you and many chinese platforms.  # 2. Which agent to use?  The community is filled with many options of agents. Due to this, it's best to understand why specific ones are better than others. Over the years, I have used several agents and many of them have been out-ranked by others due to their lack of features, high shipping prices, and lack of customer support as new agents come along. This is why I highly recommend using PandaBuy. PandaBuy offers the most honest, swift, and most importantly professional customer experience you can get. **They're also creating unique features that no other agent is offering. This is why a majority of the community is starting to move towards PandaBuy.** In this guide I will continue to make examples and tutorials only about PandaBuy's information. I am sorry if you use another agent but just keep PandaBuy in mind when you plan your next haul.  Use any agent you want, there are many out there. However, I *highly recommend* using PandaBuy due to their unique features catered to the replica community and pricing.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # III - The PandaBuy Guide + [Unlimited 5% Signup Bonus](https://www.pandabuy.com/login?id=1&inviteCode=FashionReps)  # 1.

PandaBuy Unique Features  PandaBuy is set to be different than other agents by creating unique features for the community to use. Below are some of the key features that **made my experience far better and put them a mile ahead of other agents.**  # Taobao Shop Navigation  Navigating directly through their site, not requiring a taobao account.. you can view all the products from a seller.

FashionReps Terminology  **QC:** Quality Control (QC for short) is talking about pictures that are posted from an agent of an item that was ordered. Users will post these if they're unsure about the quality and would rather have someone else take a look at them if they're good enough.  **LC:** Legit Check (LC for short) This is a tag used for posts requiring a legit check. Legit checks are a great way of finding out if a item you're purchasing is authentic or not.  **GP:** Guinea Pig (GP for short) You will be the first person to order a sellers new item. This means you'll be the first to get pictures of their product and often times you'll post them to be checked for quality by the community.  **FIND:** Much like the name states. Posts with this flair are often linked to new products that haven't been posted before.  **W2C:**: Where To Cop (W2C for short) W2C refers to the search for a desired item. Often times will be linked with retail images for an example.  **1:1**: One to One (1:1 for short) 1:1 refers to a perfect replica. However, not many exist and often times you won't be able to get these as they're sold out.  **GL**: Green Light (GL for short) GL Refers to a user who has given their approval of a QC post.  **RL**: Red Light (RL for short) RL Refers to a user who has given their disapproval of a QC post.  **B&S**: Bait & Switch (BS or B&S for short) B&S Refers to a seller who has advertised their product and sent goods that are different from advertised.  2. Tops  **Â∞∫Á†Å:** Size  **È¢ÜÂÆΩ**: Neck width  **È¢ÜÈïø**: Collar length  **ËÇ©ÂÆΩ**: Shoulder width  **Ë¢ñÈïø**: Sleeve length  **Ë¢ñÂõ¥**: Sleeve circumference  **Ë¢ñÂè£**: Sleeve/Cuff opening  **ËÇòÂÆΩ**: Elbow width  **ËÉ∏Âõ¥**: Bust width; Chest width  3.

Now find a reasonably priced and good looking product for your needs!  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # VI - How To Avoid Customs  **1. Intro Revised**  Ok this may be the most important part of my Guide. How to avoid customs - especially when you are living in Europe (s/o to Germany). Not everything changed, but there are some IMPORTANT steps that I added to the checklist. DHL is the way to go for Germany, Austria and many more European countries. Do not use EMS in Germany or Austria.  If you live **in the US or Canada you can choose EMS, DHL or GD-Sal.** Customs are pretty relaxed in these countries. For the US and Canada, shipping hauls up to 10kg generally isn't a problem. Some people even do more. Do so at your own risk. For the USA, the declaration value doesn't matter much, as you are unlikely to be taxed. For Canada, declare the package 10-14USD. Also, If you live in Canada, it is advised that you use EMS or GD-SAL. If you use DHL, you will be taxed upon package arrival.  **2. Checklist For Europe**  You may have to look up laws for any import fees or regulations. These numbers are an example for PandaBuy shipping to Germany, it should work for any country though.  \[ \] Stay within .9 of a KG. [Read here for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/acw6nk/as_requested_a_short_explanation_to_superbuy/)  \[ \] Try to stay at a maximum of 4kg. Do not go over this for the safest rate.  \[ \] If possible ask for no cardboard wrapping, let them package in DHL plastic bag  \[ \] Ask for vacuum sealing (Possible in the fewest cases)  \[ \] Ask them to wrap up your whole package with tape, a lot of tape.  \[ \] Let them put a Commercial invoice on the outside (!)! of your package  \[ \] The commercial invoice should have a value UNDER $24 including shipping costs  \[ \] The commercial invoice has to be readable, if it has printing errors it has to be printed again  \[ \] The commercial invoice has to state the shipping costs with a value >$0  \[ \] The commercial invoice has to have a sender address  \[ \] Your telephone number has to be stated on the commercial invoice  \[ \] Let them send you a copy of the commercial invoice to your email (Will come back to this)  It is strongly advised that you go to Google and type in ""\[Your country\] customs fashionreps"".  **By doing this, you will get a good grasp of what others have done. Trust me, your situation is not unique.**  https://preview.redd.it/9jgai4e05seb1.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&s=61e6472c3f3cff1cadf44894038fb389c20ed102  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # VII - General Tips About PandaBuy/Shipping  * Use [Rehearsel Shipping](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/8n8hq2/how_to_save_money_on_superbuy_shipping/) to avoid paying too much shipping costs * You can ship shoeboxes - Do not ship more than 2 shoeboxes in one package * You can ship as many packages as you want simultaneously (Keep calm tho) * Think twice before shipping shoeboxes, if you don't need them, don't ship them and let PandaBuy throw them away. They're heavy and require volumetric weight. * If you have a non-Rep haul then you can probably use other shipping methods. Decide on your own. * I recommend you to use the service called [17Track](https://www.17track.net/en) to track your packages. No matter the tracking number [17Track](https://www.17track.net/en) usually can decipher it and track it for you. * If PandaBuy does not let you pay for your replicas directly through Paypal, just top up your account balance and then pay through your balance.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # VIII - What Happens When Your Haul Gets Seized By Customs  **Outside of United States**  Keep. The. F\*\*\*. Calm. This can have so many reasons. And I want to correct myself, there is a difference between your parcel is held up by customs and your parcel being seized by customs. Let me take all the fear from you.  If your parcel is held up DHL probably just messaged/emailed/called you and they told you some long story about some value declaration and so on. To keep it short: DHL does not trust your invoice/can't read the invoice/is bored af and wants a proof of payment to declare the value of your haul. For DHL Germany it is really easy to do this. You go to [this DHL Link](https://www.dhl.de/express/dhl4you) fill out the information and upload a Paypal/Bank wire/Western Union/Payment Screenshot. For any other country: Search for the email address of DHL Express Customs (not normal DHL) in your country. You can also call the DHL Express hotline and ask them. Email them the same proof of payment screenshot.  The bad side is that you will probably have to pay some importing fees (EUSt in Germany are 19% + 12,50‚Ç¨ DHL fees). I can tell you that DHL Customs will not check if you send them an authentic screenshot of your Paypal transaction or if you managed to change up some digits in order to stay under $24. To save the importing fees. I cannot tell you how to do it, though of course. Google inspect element... This is why it was important, that PandaBuy sent you the Commercial Invoice they put on the parcel - You know exactly how high they declared it and what they stated is inside.  The Tracking status should be ""Clearance Event"" when they want the proof of payment and should change to ""Clearance processing completed"" when it is done. This can take up to several days after you send them the screenshot.  If your haul really got seized (Tracking status ""Please contact DHL"") there is nothing you can do. DHL will send you a letter where they will ask you for your permission to destroy the items. Just ignore this letter. It will automatically count as a permission (in Germany). There is nothing else. You don't go to jail, you don't get a Million $ fine. Some DHL Customs worker told me that if you stay under 3 shoes per package they will not contact the brand. But keep in mind, this is TOTALLY random. If you follow the checklist there is a micro chance that you package will even get inspected. Because inspecting alone is not enough, so many DHL workers just don't care and pass Nike, Adidas, Gucci Fakes. And if you really are that unlucky, just deal with it. Some sellers send out a replacement for free, some don't. You, Your family and your future kids will be safe, don't worry.  **Inside the United States**  If your package was seized within Chinese borders often times the Agent will refund you the full parcel price. Meaning if your haul went to the value of ¬•2,000 then you will be reimbursed ¬•2,000 directly to your PandaBuy account.  If your package was seized or taken in for inspection by United States Customs then you will be given a call or a notice that DHL, EMS, or your selected shipping company has took in your package. **Do not panic.** Often times when they take your package in for inspection they will ask you to provide a receipt or invoice for the declaration of value for your haul. Seizures and inspections are 100% random and aren't able to bypassed through any method. To keep it short: DHL does not trust your invoice/can't read the invoice/is bored af and wants a proof of payment to declare the value of your haul. For DHL Germany it is really easy to do this. You go to [this DHL Link](https://www.dhl.de/express/dhl4you) fill out the information and upload a Paypal/Bank wire/Western Union/Payment Screenshot. For any other country: Search for the email address of DHL Express Customs (not normal DHL) in your country. You can also call the DHL Express hotline and ask them. Email them the same proof of payment screenshot.  After this step you will need to wait for the review period to end and if everything went well then your package will be released to you. If your package was seized and they send you a letter than it is best to say you didn't order the item and take the loss on the haul.  **This rarely happens.**  # VIII - Useful Links And Seller Stores  Ok this was the Big Customs/FashionReps Newbie Guide/PandaBuy Guide v6.0. If you have any remarks/questions feel free to hit me up. I will add some links that are quite useful and try to update it as often as possible:  * [Use Taobao Image Search](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/6kx1e5/how_to_taobao_image_search_china_taobao/) * [FashionReps Newbie Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/ae540e/guide_help_im_new_where_do_i_start_fashionreps/) * [How to properly measure](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/ae540e/guide_help_im_new_where_do_i_start_fashionreps/) * [Trusted Seller List (Low Risk)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/wiki/trusted) * [How much will my haul cost?](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/hwikz4/how_much_will_my_haul_cost_to_ship_and_other/) * [Massive List of Shops](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/i6r9bp/yupoo_seller_starter_pack_for_the_newbies_and/)  # IX - Typically Weights Of Each Item To Estimate Costs  Credit to reddit user. [/u/125ba](https://www.reddit.com/u/125ba/). Please note these are just averages. Depends on sizing and quality.  https://preview.redd.it/xmq8el4efmcb1.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a3df7c664a47580a4b8519924378b8e8d0c7cb1  # X - How To Make Your Haul Cheaper  You will need to do rehearsal shipping once you have all your items in your warehouse. In short, you pay a small fee (around ¬•20) for someone to package up all of your stuff, weigh it, measure it, and put these figures into the shipping calculator for a final cost.  There are two ways to do rehearsal shipping and you do this from your warehouse in PandaBuy.  1. With PandaBuy, they are more or less spot on with their revised methods of weighing. 2. You can still opt for Rehearsal Shipping but it should not be used every order.  *Typically*, you will see a new reduction by doing this.  # XI - I Shipped, Now Where Is My Parcel?  You wait till it arrives! But here are some FAQ's.  **Q - How long should my parcel take to arrive?**  China Post‚Äôs tracking service documents the average arrival times of all parcels for some frequent countries as follows. If your haul has not arrived and the ‚Äúlongest‚Äù number of days has not elapsed, you should not be concerned.  Country - Average Delivery Time - Longest Time - Shortest Time  * Australia / New Zealand : 12 - 15 - 9 * Canada : 30 - 60 - 10 * EU : 17 - 44 - 7 * United Kingdom : 12 - 40 - 6 * United States : 16 - 62 - 4  As you can see, *a delivery time of 40+ days for Europe and North America is frequent*. (source: China Post)  **Q - What does ‚Äúshipping notice received‚Äù (or similar) mean?**  This means the agent has put a tracking number from China Post on your parcel (i.e. a sticker with a barcode and scanned it), but has not shipped the goods yet. It can take two to three business days for the goods to be shipped as the agent will be waiting for China Post to collect the goods. In most cases, sellers will take immediate action to ship the goods to avoid disputes and reputational damage.  **Q - It's been a couple of days since I finalized my haul, why hasn't anything happened?**  In general, to avoid disappointment you should start counting days from when the parcel is collected (it says this specifically on your agent's site and on 17track) rather than the date you submitted the parcel.  Paying for your parcel today doesn't mean it will be in the hands of China Post tomorrow - it takes time to physically bundle up the parcel, allocate a tracking number and get China Post to physically collect at the warehouse. It can often take two to three business days for this to happen and your haul to update that the tracking number has been activated.  Agents and (more frequently) direct sellers will tell you ""the item has shipped, but the shipping company hasn't given the tracking information yet"" when in reality your parcel is still in the warehouse  **Q - There seem to be a lot of delays, should I ship my parcel now or wait?**  This is similar to driving to a friend‚Äôs house cross-country when the traffic is awful all the time - the sooner you leave, the sooner you‚Äôll get there. Things won‚Äôt be any faster by delaying your haul.  **Q - Has my haul been seized?!**  In all likelihood, no. Your parcel status will update saying it is being inspected by customs at the point of seizure. A lack of status updates is probably a good thing in that sense.  **Q - Is my parcel lost?**  In all likelihood, no. These things are very rare and if you are worried about this happening you should purchase the relevant insurance protection from your agent before finalizing your shipment.  **Q - My parcel has been scanned by customs but it hasn't been updated to say customs has been cleared. Has my haul been seized?**  In all likelihood, no. The scan to confirm the parcel has cleared customs doesn‚Äôt necessarily take place in the warehouse and often takes place while the parcel is being loaded into a lorry or when it arrives at your local sorting office.  **Q - What can I do to hurry things up?**  Literally nothing. This is how international shipping works, so get comfortable with it.

"Nike,LV","quality,opinions,popular","How to Build a Smart Wardrobe with Reps What‚Äôs up Repfam, hope yall are handling your quarantine swell. I wanted to make this post really to better understand my own taste and analyze why I like what I like. So some of this advice, but mostly probably just rants lol.  Like some of you, I have a TERRIBLE spending habit when unchecked. While I‚Äôve been quarantined, I‚Äôve been spending my days browsing this subreddit, Grailed, Depop, eBay, Ssense (super good sale going rn btw, def check it out)‚Ä¶ you name it. And I know some of you guys are probably on the same boat as me. That being said, I know when someone spends that much time on these sites, it‚Äôs hard to not want everything you see. So this post is to help you build a smarter wardrobe.. that includes reps.  **1. Have a good ratio.**  First thing I wanted to mention is that reps are almost never my first option. This is a post about building a smart wardrobe WITH reps not a smart wardrobe OF reps. I personally don‚Äôt think your closet should even be 50:50 and if it‚Äôs any more than that, you‚Äôre probably trying to live a lifestyle you can‚Äôt afford and if ANYTHING is gonna get you called out, it‚Äôs exactly that.  So back to buying retail vs. reps, I would much rather hit on SNKRS for a pair of Jordans than buy the reps, but if that bullshit app doesn‚Äôt put me through, and it‚Äôs a release I was super hyped about, I‚Äôll consider buying the rep. This is because: 1. The high I get from hitting on SNKRS is only second to the high of Grade A cocaine. And 2. For a 1:1 pair of shoes, nowadays you are likely gonna end up paying maybe 30 bucks less than what retail was. So I might as well try to support the artists behind the shoe if I can.  If I don‚Äôt hit, then it‚Äôs open season. They‚Äôve made all the money they can from the shoe and I‚Äôm not gonna put money in the hands of some piece of shit 16 year old with his mom‚Äôs credit card and a bot. I will never pay $400, let alone $1,000 for a $160 sneaker. I‚Äôd rather find the closest possible 1:1 rep of it and rock it with confidence.  **2. Resell/Longevity**  ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I know I just shit on resellers in my last point, but hey, it‚Äôs a dog eat dog world, baby. One of the first things that go through my mind when I‚Äôm considering buying a piece for retail is how much money I can make back if I decided to sell it. That being said, don‚Äôt fucking sell your reps as retail you fucking scummy ass bummy ass motherfuckers. That shit is beyond unethical and is literally stealing and I hope your grandmothers get coronavirus.  But my point is, assuming that you‚Äôre reading this and you‚Äôre not a walking shit stain, when you buy reps, the second you buy them they are virtually unsellable, unless you‚Äôre selling on [r/FashionRepsBST](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionRepsBST/) where hopefully you‚Äôll AT MOST break even. When you buy retail and vintage, certain pieces will hold their value even if you rock them for years. Reps can‚Äôt be investment pieces. So when you‚Äôre buying reps, you have to understand that they are sunk costs. It‚Äôs not money you can get back. Which takes me to my next point‚Ä¶  **3. Be picky.**  When it comes to your reps, BE PICKY. Read reviews. Write reviews. Engage in the discourse. Not only will this save you from buying shit you don‚Äôt need, but it also makes reps better. Force the rep makers to boost the quality control; I‚Äôm sure most of us wouldn‚Äôt mind paying a bit of a premium if we can guarantee a 1:1. And when I say ‚Äúbe picky‚Äù, I don‚Äôt just mean QCing your stuff. I‚Äôm also talking about taking a step back and thinking about why you want the piece.  Also, I understand GPing. I‚Äôve done it. But don‚Äôt go out GPing things that you aren‚Äôt dead-set on having. I get that it‚Äôs good for the culture, but you aren‚Äôt gonna build a smart wardrobe by gambling. What happens more often than not is that you get it in the mail, it‚Äôs terrible, and you just spent $20 on a pair of Yeezys, spent $40 to ship it half way across the world just to throw it in the trash or give it to your little cousin. So please be considerate of your closet and the environment. And fuck your little cousin, tell him to make his own bread.  **4. Wearability**  Yes, we can agree that Off-White Chicago 1s are a dope ass shoe. But if you‚Äôre wearing them every day, you‚Äôre gonna look like a big tool.. but if you switch off every day with the UNC and NRG color ways and maybe throw in some Travis Scott‚Äôs every once in a while‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ **YOU‚ÄôRE GONNA LOOK LIKE AN ENORMOUS TOOL.** All these super hype shoes are fire as fuck, we can almost all agree on that, but if all you wear are BOGOs and hype shoes, you are not impressing anyone, if anything people usually look at you like the fool who is a slave to hype and can‚Äôt form opinions for themselves. Your closet does not and should not look like Qias Omar‚Äôs or Blake Linder‚Äôs. These dudes are characters on their own TV shows. It‚Äôs not realistic. And I‚Äôm not hating on them, but you have to understand that this is their business. They‚Äôre getting paid for this shit so they need to buy every shoe in order to make the content that puts the roof over their heads. I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt care about it, but you also have to look at that stuff from a business perspective. They wouldn‚Äôt own half the shit they had if it wasn‚Äôt for Youtube/Instagram.  Also, probably the biggest takeaway from this and one of my biggest pet peeves: just because it looks good on **(insert your fashion icon here)** doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs gonna look good on you. You have to understand your own proportions and wear what suits you. I understand that we wear certain pieces because they emote a feeling of nostalgia or we just connect to it at more than just at a surface level, and that‚Äôs dope. More power to you. But if you think just because it looks good in pictures of **(insert your fashion icon here)** that you‚Äôll be able to pull it off in the same way, you are sorely mistaken. And you'll probably have a bunch of shit collecting dust in the back of your closet.  Stock up on your basics, man. Trust me when I say that the classics will never die. Levi‚Äôs 501s will never die. Dickies will never die. Chucks will never die. AF1s will never die. Combat Boots will never die. Basic hoodies will never die. Hype dies. Think about it this way: One day when your kids see photos of you in your heyday and they see the clothes you were wearing, do you want them to think ‚ÄúDamn, Pops had the drip‚Äù or ‚ÄúDamn, wtf were you wearing‚Äù and then you have to explain to them that it was popular back then. You decide. Are you gonna be an Air Force 1? Or a Roshe Run? Are you gonna be a Nike Cortez? Or a Balenciaga Triple S?  **5. Personality**  This should go without saying, but wear what YOU like. Gain inspiration from different places. Just because hidden.ny posted it doesn‚Äôt mean you have to like it. Inspiration and imitation are two completely different things. The way I see it is: imagine **(insert your fashion icon here)** is one of your homies and you start rocking every thing they‚Äôre wearing.. that shit is gonna look mad corny. Take as much inspiration as you need, but wear what you like, man. There are a million brands out there. Experiment with different silhouettes and proportions. Fashion is a form of expression, so express yourself the way you want to be seen and heard.  And PLEASE, for the love of GOD, support your friends clothing brands. I know you guys all know one or two people trying to start up a clothing line and I PROMISE you that supporting your homies is cooler than any pair of Yeezys you can own and it speaks more on you than any pair of Jordans you can own. Buying their $30 tee is a hell of a lot cooler than buying another pair of 158sir Ultraboosts.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  **Conclusion**  If you made it this far, I just wanna say wow thank you. I don‚Äôt know how you did it. A lot of this is just ramblings of a sleep deprived guy so don‚Äôt take anything I‚Äôm saying as gospel. I‚Äôd love to hear any of your tips as well as I‚Äôm also slowly developing my own taste. If you agree with anything I said, let me know. If you disagree, let me know. If I made you laugh or cry, let me know. After all, this is a forum. I‚Äôd love to hear what you guys think. But if you‚Äôre one of those guys who comment ‚ÄúYeS!! fUcK hYpEbEaSts!!

Introduction  Hey repfam!  Hope you had a good transition into 2020 and what better to start the year off with a nice review!  W2C: [Link (959y)](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-1254465541.51.6be5707em1AMwo&id=607022652595)  &#x200B;  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # II. Pictures  &#x200B;  First off, here you have the pictures I took.  &#x200B;  [Here is the album](https://imgur.com/a/3Dsi5k4)!  &#x200B;  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  &#x200B;  # III. Thoughts & On Person  &#x200B;  **Note**: He advertises a dust bag, didn't get one. Even got QC pictures the first time and he assured me I'd get one..  [Very well and thick puffer jacket.](https://imgur.com/a/qBPXHmD)  The material is very unique. It shimmers in different colours depending on how the light hits the down jacket.  It has a blue tint but can change to black or a slight purple. The pattern also ""changes"" since half of the pattern is matte and the other half is reflective.  The zippers are massive. Very well made and heavy. There are also clasps to tighten the cuff on the bottom, so no wind goes up your jacket.  Jacket is filled with down and is super thick. Comparing to my TopStoney Down Jacket from late 2017 (the good one), it's twice as thick and super warm.  I went Size 48 and it fits nice. A bit roomy but not oversize.  Outside are two ""invisible"" pockets and inside are two more pockets, with branded ""CD"" buttons.  The collar is so nice. It's a stand-up collar which is filled with down as well.   Wore this outside at 2 Celsius with just a T-Shirt under it and didn't freeze - I would've if I had my Stone Island one on.  &#x200B;  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # IV. Shipping & Contact  &#x200B;  Rick had a few problems with the latest batch he got from the factory.  Some had the fabric put on on reverse.  He sent me QC pictures and fair enough, I did get the bad batch.  I asked him if he would exchange for the correct one and he agreed.  I never got pictures, I never got a tracking number, it just showed up - and the weirdest thing is, it came from **France with DHL**.  Sadly, Rick answers once every 3 days (fair enough, Christmas and New Years Eve) so be cautious.  Went through customs without a problem (well, I wouldn't have known anyways) and took 3 days over Christmas.  If I would rate it:  Shipping: 5/5  Contact: 2/5 (late responses and no QC & shipping number for the new jacket)  &#x200B;  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  &#x200B;  # V. Closing it up  &#x200B;  Jacket is very well made and perfect for winter.  I went size 48 (178cm / 65kg) and it fits very nice.  You can layer a nice T-Shirt and crewneck under it no problem.  Price is worth it in my opinion and I am very satisfied with my purchase.  &#x200B;  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  Ignore those tags for searchbar: dior oblique all over pattern puffer down jacket rickstudio supremeslp rick studio   I hope you liked my short review.

Pictures don't work on mobile, so apologies to all my fellow mobile users out there 2. It's normal for the spreadsheet to be stuck on 'Working' or 'Loading' for a few minutes, give it some time and it'll load! 3. There are 2 pages, with the first page being Taobao links, the second page is Weidian links. 4. Pictures messed up / not showing up like [this](https://imgur.com/a/O1ZYdjF)? Try making a copy (Go to the top left - > File -> Make a Copy) of the spreadsheet or any of the backup spreadsheets. If that doesn't work, try using a different browser. 5. Is (item link) from the list worth purchasing? Check for Taobao reviews before purchasing. Taobao reviews can be found directly under the item photos, it's the ""Á¥ØËÆ°ËØÑËÆ∫"" or ""Total reviews"" tab. Click that and scroll down for some reviews, and check the "" ÂõæÁâá"" or ""Pictures"" circle to filter the results into showing reviews with pictures. You will need a Taobao account to access this. Google Translate is your friend here. If there's no reviews or no reviews with pictures, then buy with caution. 6. Why is (item link) redirecting me to [world.taobao.com](https://world.taobao.com/)? Is the link dead? Nope, the link is still working. Paste it into your agent to view it, or VPN to another country and open the link again. Countries like India and China work fine for me, but there are definitely more countries that you can VPN to. 7. Problem not related to any above?

They're under ""product review"" or ""ÂïÜÂìÅËØÑ‰ª∑"", if you can't see that section, try scrolling down below the size/color selection area. * Where are the sizes/colors? They're right below the title of the item, under ""ËØ∑ÈÄâÊã©ÂûãÂè∑"" or ""Please select model"". If you can't find that section, try clicking/pressing the grey ""Âä†ÂÖ•Ë¥≠Áâ©ËΩ¶"" button.  For listings without sizes/colors, check the item description, usually above or below the pictures provided under reviews. * How do I purchase these shoes? Check this part of Cedaz's video [here](https://youtu.be/3YafPlqeqUc?t=189), or follow the hundreds of guides written by this great community! * Why is the size/color I want greyed out, and it isn't clickable? That means it's out of stock, and it isn't purchasable at the moment. Try contacting the seller to see if there will be a restock. * Why can't my agent purchase the shoes? Usually, the case is that your agent might have returned too many pairs back to the seller, causing them to refuse to sell to them. This isn't rare, Ytaopal and WeGoBuy have several cases of this happening. * Does more reviews = better quality? No. Reviews can be easily faked, I added them as a reference number. Always check the review pictures that are provided by users, and disregard the reviews with stock images instead of actual images of the product. * Why is there a + sign after the colorways number? That means that the seller can be contacted for more colorways, and more options are available than the ones listed. * Why wasn't (insert cheap seller here) listed? I wanted more of a variety, so I tried to stay away from sellers like 158sir and WTG.  rip wallets #budgetgang;;WHY DOES NOBODY MAKE ANYTHING ABOVE 46 i hate having big feet","{upvote:18,timestamp:2020-11-04}",Reddit,1,0

"Gucci,Cartier",price,"Aooko Prescription Review Purchasing: Very very simple. You can use an agent or direct buy from Aooko. I decided to buy directly from him. Total cost was roughly 174 USD or 239 CAD through paypal friends and family. What‚Äôs up number: +86 150 1401 6248   Step 1 find his Yupoo, password is optical001, find the glasses you want & screenshot them.  Step 2: message him on whatsapp with the glasses you want to purchase, he will get back to you with a price, if you want prescription - price will increase by 35 USD. shipping is standard at $8 USD  step 3: Pay him & wait.   Timeline: Messaged Aooko on November 12. Finalized and paid on November 13 Sent Prescription & pupil distance after I paid (weird) QC received on November 17 Shipped November 18. Received December 9   **last 2 slides is the weight of my retail Gucci & Tom Ford  Communication with Aooko was a 10/10, you may have to wait a little for a response but it‚Äôs because of the time zones so didn‚Äôt bother me at all. When I do get a response it is with clarity & consistency, respect eachother and you will be respected    Review: I find it very hard to find a pair of glasses that look good on every person who wears them. It‚Äôs best you go to your local eye doctor. Find the frame that you like, and see if Aooko carries it. This way you will save a lot of money & get a pair of glasses that you know will look good on you.  Cartier: I am honestly a little disappointed in the cartier frames. Not because of the style but honestly because of the weight. I honestly have no clue if these frames are fantasy but frankly i don‚Äôt care. For the price though, if it does break I can always purchase another   I took them out of the package & thought it was empty, it‚Äôs almost as light as a quarter. I‚Äôm not sure if retail cartier frames are this light but it almost feels as if it‚Äôs going to break if the wind pushes it too hard. With it being so light, it doesn‚Äôt sit on the face properly as it just shifts with small facial expression. Kind of disappointing.  For reference: My retail gucci frames weigh about 33grams & my retail tom ford frames weigh about 36grams. Not too heavy but a solid weight for frames. (Available pictures on last 2 slides)   Pros: Looks good, slim. gold seems accurate compared to my retail frames of other brands that are gold. Prescription seems spot on, 1:1 compared to my retail from the optometrist in terms of prescription   Cons: Susceptible to bending, extremely light weight (May be a pro to some, but this is my interpretation, make your own review). The arms on the frames almost feel like an after thought, there is no sturdiness to them & it‚Äôs almost as if they want to fall off. I may have to go to my doctor to tighten them  Would I buy again: Absolutely, but probably a different frame style that‚Äôs a little heavier   Chrome hearts: Shape is solid, weight is solid, prescription is solid. Sits on the face extremely well, looks extremely good. There is nothing I would change about these frames. If you‚Äôre thinking about it, go for it. 10/10 Is it fantasy? I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt care, it looks good  Cons: cant think of any  Would I buy again:  Absolutely, not even a question.  Verdict: I have owned a total of 4 frames in my time (I‚Äôm 23) and the amount of money spent on them is insane. Knowing that Rep frames WITH prescription is attainable has opened up a whole new world.;;Need those Chrome Hearts glasses","{upvote:7,timestamp:2022-12-10}",Reddit,0,
Nike,trends,"What I‚Äôve learned after 90+ KG of Reps. Hey, first of all sorry for my bad English and grammar.  Today I wanted to discuss about reps, or clothes in general, since we‚Äôre in FashionReps‚Äô Reddit Page.  I‚Äòve shipped almost 90KG (90.000g) of reps in the past one and a half year and I kept everything I bought, didn‚Äôt get rid of anything (yet).  At first, everything was amazing, I was satisfying myself with every single piece I dreamed of since I was a kid. However, thing is that switching from a calm ‚ÄúNike sports tee, $25 jeans, air forces air max style‚Äù to a full on ‚Äúexpensive clothes, flex style‚Äù destroyed my whole fashion sense and taste.  I forgot about what I would actually see myself wearing everyday, I just wanted to look ‚Äúcool‚Äù to other people and ‚Äúheal‚Äù my inner child that couldn‚Äôt afford all that stuff back then. So, everytime I was discovering something that was trendy or cool to others, I was switching my whole style. Now, I feel like I kind of found my own style that I enjoy wearing everyday, however that‚Äôs what I said in the past about all the other styles I‚Äôve tried / had.  My point is that out of those 90KG, I got a lot of stuff (more than a third) that I worn once or maybe twice and then I just threw away because my style changed.  Do not fall for trends, be yourself and do not get clothes until you find your true style. You don‚Äôt have to look cool to anyone but yourself.   Don‚Äôt try to impress others, you‚Äôll become like me, addicted to clothes, changing styles every 3 months and forgetting about every other clothing item you bought in the past.   Keep it simple. Be yourself and don‚Äôt change if you don‚Äôt feel like you need to.;;Exactly bro, I see those kids buying designer clothes for school and I wish they could understand that people opinions doesn't matter at all, you should wear what makes you, you.","{upvote:8,timestamp:2023-08-28}",Reddit,0,

They're under ""product review"" or ""ÂïÜÂìÅËØÑ‰ª∑"", if you can't see that section, try scrolling down below the size/color selection area. * Where are the sizes/colors? They're right below the title of the item, under ""ËØ∑ÈÄâÊã©ÂûãÂè∑"" or ""Please select model"". If you can't find that section, try clicking/pressing the grey ""Âä†ÂÖ•Ë¥≠Áâ©ËΩ¶"" button.  For listings without sizes/colors, check the item description, usually above or below the pictures provided under reviews. * How do I purchase these shoes? Check this part of Cedaz's video [here](https://youtu.be/3YafPlqeqUc?t=189), or follow the hundreds of guides written by this great community! * Why is the size/color I want greyed out, and it isn't clickable? That means it's out of stock, and it isn't purchasable at the moment. Try contacting the seller to see if there will be a restock. * Why can't my agent purchase the shoes? Usually, the case is that your agent might have returned too many pairs back to the seller, causing them to refuse to sell to them. This isn't rare, Ytaopal and WeGoBuy have several cases of this happening. * Does more reviews = better quality? No. Reviews can be easily faked, I added them as a reference number. Always check the review pictures that are provided by users, and disregard the reviews with stock images instead of actual images of the product. * Why is there a + sign after the colorways number? That means that the seller can be contacted for more colorways, and more options are available than the ones listed. * Why wasn't (insert cheap seller here) listed? I wanted more of a variety, so I tried to stay away from sellers like 158sir and WTG.  rip wallets #budgetgang;;This sub really about to make me request more hours smh.","{upvote:42,timestamp:2020-11-04}",Reddit,1,1

,haul,"""w h e r e i s m y p a r c e l"" and other tales of the sea - a brief guide to international shipping and why your haul is probably fine What up repfam  This post explains 90% of the questions people have about shipping, including such classics as ‚Äúwhere is my shit‚Äù, ‚Äúhas my haul been seized‚Äù, and ""where is my shit"" again.  First up, this guide applies for EMS parcels. EUB parcels follow the same process, but have sporadic updates (often going for weeks at a time). Also there is some UK-centric language but the thrust applies worldwide.  &#x200B;  **Q - How does international shipping work?**  Once you put your shipment together via your agent, there are basically three stages to your haul arriving at your door  * Getting the package prepared for export from China including clearing export customs (1) * Getting the package on an aircraft (2) * Your parcel clearing import customs in your country so it can be delivered to you (3).  At Stage (1), your agent bundles the parcel together and the necessary export customs formalities are filed (i.e. declaring what is in the package and the total value of the goods). The goods are transported to a cargo warehouse at an airport in China, where they may be inspected by export customs.  Very occasionally, the goods will not be allowed to be exported and will be returned to the warehouse - this happens for numerous reasons ranging from the parcel not being properly sealed, to the wrong customs details being filed, to the package being opened and counterfeit goods being seized.  Your parcel moves into Stage (2) when Chinese customs approve them for export and they are moved into an airside cargo warehouse. At this point it is tallied, planned for loading on an aircraft, put together with other parcels and then loaded onto an aircraft to start its journey towards your country.  This is frequently a long stage in the process. EMS and EUB parcels are transported in the hold of commercial aircraft which have finite capacity, so in situations where this capacity is reduced (i.e. less aircraft are flying like now with COVID-19) or where demand is high (i.e. at Christmas or Chinese New Year) there are more parcels than it is possible to fit on an aircraft. Your parcel will be held in the secure area of the warehouse until it is possible to board an aircraft.  Once your parcel has made its journey to your country, you enter Stage (3). Once disembarked from the aircraft your parcel is taken into another cargo warehouse where it is scanned to confirm arrival in the country and is presented to import customs for inspection. While export customs is a formality and the vast majority of parcels are waved through by import customs, instances of detailed customs inspection and seizure at this stage are somewhat more frequent.  Once your parcel clears import customs, it is transported within your country to the relevant local delivery agent who delivers it to your door. Depending on the size of your country, this can take a substantial amount of time.  &#x200B;  **Q - How long should my parcel take to arrive?**  China Post‚Äôs tracking service documents the average arrival times of all parcels for some frequent countries as follows. If your haul has not arrived and the ‚Äúlongest‚Äù number of days has not elapsed, you should not be concerned.  Country - Average Delivery Time - Longest Time - Shortest Time  * Australia / New Zealand : 12 - 15 - 9 * Canada : 30 - 60 - 10 * EU : 17 - 44 - 7 * United Kingdom : 12 - 40 - 6 * United States : 16 - 62 - 8  As you can see, *a delivery time of 40+ days for Europe and North America is frequent*. (source: China Post)  &#x200B;  **Q - What does ‚Äúshipping notice received‚Äù (or similar) mean?**  This means the agent has put a tracking number from China Post on your parcel (i.e. a sticker with a barcode and scanned it), but has not shipped the goods yet. It can take two to three business days for the goods to be shipped as the agent will be waiting for China Post to collect the goods.  Infrequently, if you have purchased directly from a seller and have chased them to confirm your goods have been shipped after QC, some asswipes will give you a fake tracking number. If the status remains ‚Äúshipping notice received‚Äù after four days or more you should chase them to actually ship the goods. In most cases, sellers will take immediate action to ship the goods to avoid disputes and reputational damage.  &#x200B;  **Q - It's been a couple of days since I finalised my haul, why hasn't anything happened?**  In general, to avoid disappointment you should start counting days from when the parcel is collected (it says this specifically on your agent's site and on 17track) rather than the date you submitted the parcel.  Paying for your parcel today doesn't mean it will be in the hands of China Post tomorrow - it takes time to physically bundle up the parcel, allocate a tracking number and get China Post to physically collect at the warehouse. It can often take two to three business days for this to happen and your haul to update that the tracking number has been activated.  Agents and (more frequently) direct sellers will tell you ""the item has shipped, but the shipping company hasn't given the tracking information yet"" when in reality your parcel is still in the warehouse - sometimes it takes a week to be picked up.  &#x200B;  **Q - What does ‚Äúdelivered to air transport‚Äù / ‚Äúdespatched to \[my country\]‚Äù (or similar) mean?**  This means that China Post has given the parcel to the airline company - it does NOT mean that the parcel is on a plane.  This status will not update for a long time until the parcel arrives at the destination airport and is scanned by the domestic parcel company. It is not unheard of for this to take between two and four weeks in regular season, and four to six weeks during holiday season or where there are complications like COVID.  If you are worried you can ask your agent to confirm which flight your parcel is on. If they are able to give you a flight number, it is worth noting they do not always see the date of the flight and this could still be in the future - you should not assume your parcel has left China.  &#x200B;  **Q - How can I check progress on my parcel?**  Until the point of arrival in your country, 17track is the most detailed resource to keep up to date on your parcel‚Äôs progress. ParcelsApp also has good feedback.  &#x200B;  **Q - There seem to be a lot of delays, should I ship my parcel now or wait?**  This is similar to driving to a friend‚Äôs house cross-country when the traffic is awful all the time - the sooner you leave, the sooner you‚Äôll get there. Things won‚Äôt be any faster by delaying your haul.  &#x200B;  **Q - Has my haul been seized?!**  In all likelihood, no. Your parcel status will update saying it is being inspected by customs at the point of seizure. A lack of status updates is probably a good thing in that sense.  &#x200B;  **Q - Is my parcel lost??!?!!?1111?@**  In all likelihood, no. These things are very rare and if you are worried about this happening you should purchase the relevant insurance protection from your agent before finalising your shipment.  &#x200B;  **Q - My parcel has been scanned by customs but it hasn't been updated to say customs has been cleared. Has my haul been seized???**  In all likelihood, no. The scan to confirm the parcel has cleared customs doesn‚Äôt necessarily take place in the warehouse and often takes place while the parcel is being loaded into a lorry or when it arrives at your local sorting office. As per the above, unless there is a notice specifically saying your parcel is being inspected by customs you probably have nothing to worry about.  &#x200B;  **Q - What can I do to hurry things up?**  Literally nothing. This is how international shipping works, so get comfortable with it. Posting on the sub asking how other people‚Äôs parcels are progressing won‚Äôt make yours arrive any faster.  &#x200B;  Hope this is helpful and do ask any more questions below so we have a good FAQ resource.;;Why thank you for this lovely lovely post that I can now redirect people who don‚Äôt understand that shipping from across the world isn‚Äôt as fast as Amazon Prime 1 Day Shipping to.

The embroidery is amazing, no frays and straight. Be sure if you end up getting this to make sure your embroidery is level. The blank itself is NOT cotton... or at least not 100% cotton. I cant describe the feeling, but its almost feels like a ""rougher"" blank? It's the same material as retail so not to worry, but just wanted to mention that. **THIS IS A 9.5/10 MUST COP** (loses 10/10 due to sinking A flaw)  https://preview.redd.it/pn950go94uv21.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0094706f542ef9becbc81112494027f31c0c6e0  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  ***Supreme 20th Anniversary Tee:***  * Link: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=559557524044](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=559557524044) * Size: Large * Ôø•99.00 * 272g * This is lowkey a bust... The tee itself is actually fire and great quality, but I'm too shook to wear it. I'm not a blatant flexer, usually stick with unknown or lowkey brands, so only people who know, know that its a flex... but supreme is now a lot more known, so I feel more uncomfortable to wear it. Besides my anxiety, great tee. This is from TC and the print is high quality from what I can see, neck and wash tags also seem correct and this is the thicc-est blank of the haul. In terms of sizing... I got a large but should have got a medium. All in all, **THIS IS A 9.5/10 (only a must cop if you love having all eyes on you)**  https://preview.redd.it/uquapi5b4uv21.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26788e1d2ae6cee568fe88e4b49a6aa5642061bc  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  ***Adidas Tri-stripe Tee (BQ5371)***  * Link: DEAD * Size: Large * Ôø•50.00 * 194g * Another one of my favourite tees. The blank is not 100% cotton, its a blend of some sort that makes it stretchy. Im not sure if this is how the real shirt is, but I kinda like it and it feels good. Clean, simple, and a steal for the price....**IF YOU LIKE ADIDAS, THIS IS A 9/10 COPPP.**  https://preview.redd.it/f63tyckc4uv21.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66f01d83510fb60d76d9ef4f724d695193135ee9  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  ***Places + Faces 3M Reflective tee:***  * Link: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=561802459535](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=561802459535) * Size: Large * Ôø•55.55 * 188g * I love this shirt. Im a big fan of the 3M, makes taking pictures dope when your shirt is glowing lol. Sizing is great, quality is pretty good. I've watched it a couple times and some of the 3M started to crack.... its very minor and in the corner of one of the E's... but I mean, its gonna happen eventually. Would deff see myself buying another one when I beat up this one too much. This is a repfam classic **AND IS A 9/10 MUST COP (loses points due to cracking)**  https://preview.redd.it/nv17ojkd4uv21.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a818da0331b55fa30da142c5cf0ef458cd5639f  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  ***Champion Embroidered Chest Logo tee:***  * Link: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=587121973338](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=587121973338) * Size: Large * Ôø•79.00 * 201g * Yet another ""I love this shirt"" loool. So I was caught slacking by a fellow repfam after posting this, and forgot to even make a review of this piece, kudos to u/Papichenkofor catching it before I made a bigger fool of myself loool. Okay so back to the shirt... The embroidery on this honestly blew me away, so crisp and clean, I love how it is raised too. For 79 yuan, I'll be buying more, **THIS IS A 10/10 MUST COPPPPP (if you are into champion)**   https://preview.redd.it/u6phdwbfonv21.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba42f449d6891b5887cb51721f8de31c9b451dff  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  ***Stone Island Archivio Tee:***  * Link: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=583886193698](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=583886193698) * Size: Medium * Ôø•105.00 * 208g * It feels like I say that every shirt is my favourite... Well, this is no different lol. I love the simplistic look of this, and the back print is fire in my opinion. Copped from the goat 0832 since he had the best embroidery of the batches out at the time. Now bare in mind that retail on these had bad stitching (intentionally?), but regardless I wanted a clean stitch. Tags were also on point, probably the second most worn tee of this haul, for sure **THIS IS A 10/10 MUST COP. PERIOD.**  https://preview.redd.it/ybydwo7gonv21.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3378f122fcb810be6456549d3e301e3195b10c1  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  ***Kith x Champion*** ***Tee:***  * Link: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=587898145792](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=587898145792) * Size: Medium * Ôø•105.00 * 256g * Alright finally something I do not like ahahaha. So when reps of this first started coming out, I thought it was fire, still do... but when worn... idk. The champion part comes across the chest much more pronounced than I had thought. Also, the Kith stitched bogo isn't the most secure thing in the world. It's stitched on, so shouldn't be an issue but always worries me that after some wash it will come off lol. Besides me not liking it, the blank is nice and overall goo quality. **THIS IS A 8/10 EHHH COP.**  https://preview.redd.it/qcx0ffehonv21.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=063c0b736b7869bdbd93d899d3668acd8a0df5a0  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  ***Patagonia*** ***Tee:***  * Link: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=558577203707](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=558577203707) * Size: Large * Ôø•29.00 * 153g * This is the second ehhh tee of this haul. The actual print quality is top notch, but the blank is pretty shite... no tags or sort of patagonia branding on them... literally just a generic blank with a patagonia print, but like what did I expect for 29 yuan lol. I usually just throw this underneath a navy flannel/shirt looks pretty good. Regardless of the quality, still a dope piece. **THIS IS A 7/10 EHHH COP**  https://preview.redd.it/pfluhkaionv21.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c01109334155876f5470ced159ee3c9367a9a33  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  ***Kith x Vogue Crewneck***\*\*\*:\*\*\*  * Link: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=572996363726](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=572996363726) * Size: Large * Ôø•199.00 * 557g * This crew is CLEAN AF. I wanted this so bad . from when they released and glad that I at least copped a rep. This crew is THICC, embroidery is on point and tags look great. My only problem with this initially is that it was quick stiff (thats what she said). The crew ""stood"" on its own, didnt flop over like a normal tee or crew... After a quick google search, I whipped up a fabric softening cocktail and let it soak in it over night, and it worked like a charm! Nice flowwy, thicc blank, **THIS IS A 9.5/10 MUST COP (loses points since I had to make it less stiff)**  https://preview.redd.it/zdc1fszjonv21.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab6e6d69b552adf5956c2f068147530ee2a492b8  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  ***Stone Island Crewneck***\*\*\*:\*\*\*  * Link: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=583964572182](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=583964572182) * Size: Large * Ôø•180.00 * 506g * So every since joining this sub, Topstoney was all the rave, and tbh I never really liked SI stuff. BUT THEN ONE DAY THAT ALL CHANGED, I saw someone wearing a SI piece in my local mall and it looked dope af, I thought that the badge sticking out like that kinda looked childish, but its a lot smaller when worn and on body. Copped this badboy and was BLOWN AWAY by the quality of Topstoney, probably the comfiest crewneck I have ever worn. I had to try a couple times to get a badge, but it worked out in the end. **THIS IS 10/10 MUST COPPPPP REPFAM CLASSIC**  https://preview.redd.it/c4v42tpkonv21.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3cc548cc31a0218564ad390abe66e4ace2f5e2b6  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  ***Bunch of socks:***  * Calabasas Link: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=569978279284](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=569978279284)    * Ôø•11.88    * 54g    * Nice material, and medium thiccness **(7/10)** * Adidas Link: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=561059628229](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=561059628229)    * Ôø•12.00    * 51g    * The thinnest of the bunch, most likely due to material...

Patagonia,"quality,price,comparison","0832 CLUB PATAGONIA SHORTS REVIEW Aight boys, I know we've all been a lil down because of rona szn. Yet that shouldn't stop us from securing da *drip.* So in order to cope with my quarantine impulsiveness, I decided to cop shit even though I had no idea when it'd get here. *This gave me a reason to wake up every morning*, mostly to check the tracking lmaooo. Anyways, he posted his usual long ass videos on the sub and the shorts caught my attention. Hopped on the yupoo and saw the price and decided to pull the trigger on them hoesss.  **PRICE:**  99 Yuan X 5 + 250 Yuan shipping = 745 Yuan ($102 USD)  **TIMELINE:**   4/22 - Hit him up on WeChat and got the total price with shipping   4/23 - homie spammed me with calls and videos to check for QC at 3 AM  4/23 - I GL and he apparently shipped out that day   4/28 - Got my DHL Taiwan tracking   5/21 - finally saw moment a month later üòî  5/28 - Delivered to da doorstep   **COMMUNICATION:** Honestly, I was a lil skeptical at first since I heard he was a mid tier middleman, but it was the contrary. He replied hella fast to me and was honestly pretty funny to talk to. He gave me suggestions and offered to remove all the tags off of them to avoid being seized which I thought was pretty cool of him. He sent me plenty of QC pics and videos  to look at, even went as far as to record what they were shipping in and how. **Overall 10/10 on communication and direct shipping.**  **QUALITY:** I've honestly never really seen these in person, and or tried them on. Yet these feel pretty good and breathable, perfect for the summer to avoid getting swamp ass or bat wings. No one is gonna try to lc these hoes, and if they do, they're getting a kick in the balls. Regardless, they fit on the smaller side in terms of the waist since I‚Äôm a size 33-34. I got a large and these seem to run a tiny bit small. The length is good but I prefer a little shorter so I just rolled it up a bit. **Overall, I give it a 10/10 in quality.**  [QC PICTURES FROM 0832](https://imgur.com/a/Jocxr3g)  [RETAIL PIC AND LINK FOR COMPARISON](https://imgur.com/a/Y8vhNll)  All in all, my overall experience with 0832 was honestly one of the best, and the shorts surpassed my expectations.

They fit perfectly, feel super soft and comfy, and came with everything in the box. The only downside to these is that they feel a little too soft. I know that's good for comfort, but they feel like they could come apart easy. Got these for important work meetings and going out to fancy dinners with the girl. *Drip level* ***10/10*** *(price+quality)*  **$20** **Balenciaga Rainbow Tee** [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=600251765099&spm=1101.1101.N.N.afa3648) | [Fit Pics](https://imgur.com/a/cQlnpLJ)  Size XS - Got the smallest size for my girl. Because Balenciaga tees are so oversized it fits me like a normal. Definitely wearing it when she's out of town. I love this blank. Super good quality tee, and the embroidery looks really good compared to other reps I've seen. It only has the white outline on one letter, a little. Embroidery could probably be a little cleaner,  retail looks janky too so maybe good there. I've never seen retail in person so IDK what else to judge about it, but it looks great to me. *Drip Level* ***9/10*** *(because I don't know shit about this shirt and quality is great)*  **$12 Balenciaga Mode Tee** [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=596932369626) | [In Hand / Fit Pics](https://imgur.com/a/ReyvGMz)  Size XL - Obviously sizing is different from last one. Still has big sleeves to elude to the oversize look. The blank feels like a normal tee. I'm not sure if it should be super high quality like the other one, or if this retail is just normal cotton feeling tee. Either way, print looks clean and aligned. Again, i know nothing about QCing this but love the shirt and color.  *Drip Level* ***8/10*** *Its low-key yet drippy. Just a shirt with a logo. Regular cotton feel.*  **$5 Supreme Shoulder Bag** [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=590586380323) | [In hand / fit pics](https://imgur.com/a/DdmzYv5)  Bruh, it's a $5 dollar bag. It's actually really dope for the price. Obvious flaws at this tier but it's cool. I don't care if anyone notices the lettering being off, not too worried or concerned with call outs. This will actually be super practical for festivals and the beach and shit like that. The biggest flaw is the small supreme logo. It's super janky lol, but it's small and again is what it is for $5. *Drip level* ***7/10*** *it's what you'd expect at this tier*  **LEAD TEST FOR THE UPCOMING BRACELETS:**  [They Passed](https://imgur.com/a/5bZT4m0)  **$5 Louis Vuitton White Bracelet for men** [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=566494839589&spm=1101.1101.N.N.dba19a8) | [In Hand on wrist](https://imgur.com/a/HA1pffD)  Two sizes available, 17cm and 19cm, I got 19. Magnetic clasp. Fits perfect. I don't know, I think it's a nice accessory. No idea how to QC. I don't think it'll even get noticed much as an LV thing, just some IRL flair to add without being obnoxious about it. Feels good. And I lead tested it. It passed along with the other one I'm about to talk about.  *Drip Level* ***8/10*** *Looks good feels like a $5 bracelet lol.*  **$3.66 Small lock LV Bracelet For Women** [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=569052642865) |[In Hand](https://imgur.com/a/tgsYQ9X)  One size (18cm) Got it for my girl. She loves it. NO idea how to QC but all the markings and everything looks super clean so we fucks with it. Feels cheap also, but I think it should hold up if it's worn sparingly. *Drip Level* ***9/10*** *based on aesthetics only*  Edit: added bracelet sizes \^;;When you say lead test.. are we talking at a lab or something you did at home?","{upvote:2,timestamp:2019-08-25}",Reddit,0,

"Versace,YSL",price,"PERFUME GUY REVIEW (2x 60ML BOTTLES and 4 SAMPLES) Hello everyone so basically I won the best-dressed contest (somehow?) and I'm really thankful to chez Pierre and everyone else who provided a prize! Today I am going to review what I got from Chez Pierre! I got one free 60mL bottle WITH SHIPPING covered which was hella dope cuz its like 20 euros to the USA. I also purchased another 60mL ( with shipping still free)  So I like cologne and I have always purchased retail but tbh its kinda getting dumb bc I want so many scents but I don't really wanna spend over 90$ for a little bottle (about 60mL) and why spend that much when you can get 60mL for 15 euros from chez Pierre!   &#x200B;  [The colognes I currently use along with what I got from Chez Pierre](https://preview.redd.it/4l89nc50tdk51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c9a84a141aca723c17fa4d42cd3fa2ce3d8141b)  Here is what I got: ALSO 60mL bottles were all perfect and tightly packaged multiple times in bubble wrap. Also did I mention shipping was like 4 DAYS?? Shipped Thursday Received Monday. I was camping that weekend so it went by fast.  **1: 60mL ""Ultimate Fire"" aka Versace Eros Flame**  I got this instead of just Versace Eros because it has a bit more detail. I got this in 1:4 ratio I believe and it is quite strong! I'll just spray it less maybe only once. This scent is for church or formal gatherings and debates. I don't exactly remember how it smelled at the mall but it smells similar. I'll rate 8/10  **2: 60mL ""Immortal"" aka Invictus (aka Noah Beck scent)**  This is a cologne I got that is on the sweeter side. A going to a party or out with friends type of scent. It smells very similar to the one at the mall I just think it has a slightly different ""after smell?"" idk how to call it. But it hits all the correct general smell. I love it and will def wear it. This is actually my first ""sweet"" scent. Also Noah Beck says he wears it so if you want to be Noah beck just get this. 9/10  **Samples I got:**  **""Hint of Vanilla"" aka Tabacco Vanillie by Tom Ford**  SO this scent gets a lot of hype from this group. I got a sample because Idk about the ""tobacco"" part of it. I kind of get the hype. It kinda smells like xmas to me... def a winter scent. The vanilla isn't very strong ( i assume if it was it would give headaches ) but it smells okay. I do get the tobacco part... would I purchase? Probably not. Would need a second opinion 6/10 (just cuz i don't like the scent)  **""Fiction"" aka Lost Cherry by Tom Ford**  This is a summer scent. Sweet and reminds you of a day out with your shirt half buttoned up walking the summer streets of any tropical place. This is  a unisex scent. I LOVEE this scent but like I said, for the summer. I would buy this next year in the spring. A must if you want sexy playboy vibes. It could be worn by a woman too but I can definitely say this IS unisex.  **""Simona"" aka Si by Giorgo Armani (Female Scent)**  Got this sample for my mom. She has not smelled it yet but it smells good! This actually smells exactly like some colognes at Nordstrom. I think she will really like it because I just smelled it again and I really like it!  **""Tornado"" aka Lo Homme by YSL**  Bruh so basically I got this to compare to my retail YSl but i didn't even check and got just Lo Homme when I actually have La Nui De Lo Homme. But I'm gonna assume they're similar. This one smells amazing. Smells like you're going to a get together at some boujee high-class dinner with your rich friends. Has a combo of formal & sexy. I will be buying this in my next purchase.  **Overall,** I love the prices, everything is bang for your buck and shipping is very fast. I will get some more scents along with more samples! Ask any questions if you want!  Update; the longer the scent stays on the more it smells like retail. Also, I love Invictus I recommend every teen guy to get it 100%. Actually all the scents smell better the longer they stay on. I guess at first its strong but over time it gets perfect.;;bought from chez and I have tobacco vanilla and lost cherry.  I have to say they‚Äôre both my favorite so far from him   I‚Äôm pretty biased towards tobacco vanille since it does give off an Xmas vibe and I love Xmas   Also have a retail sample of tobacco vanille and Chez‚Äôs has a bolder smell imo.

If you have any questions just let me know:  T-Shirts:  ‚ÄûBalenciaga‚Äú Print (16,77$):   I ordered in my normal size and it fits oversized just how I wanted it. The printing feels a little cheap, but it could be worse.

"Nike,LV,Hermes,Gucci,Adidas,Prada,Uniqlo,Versace,Burberry,Ralph Lauren,Patagonia","quality,price,haul","Text Review of 5 Years of Reps (45kg+) Alright, I‚Äôve mostly started this because I‚Äôm bored during deadline season and want to do something other than reading for my final essays. I‚Äôve been around here for a long time (lurking is fun!), with my first ever haul being in January of 2018. I remember the obsession with Bogos (I got my cousin two in a haul I set up for him over the summer of 2019), as well as haul reviews before Google Slides, among other things that mark me as a Repfam boomer.  In total since 2018, I‚Äôve done a total of 5 hauls with SuperBuy, and 4 with WeGoBuy (the fourth of which will be shipped very soon, prompting this review), for a total of 45.1 kg, not including the haul I have coming which will definitely take me over 55kg. I did a fuck ton of digging in order to find some items for this most recent haul, which is going to be around 11kg, if not more, and is going to be probably 33 items. Maybe I‚Äôll release a QC album of that, not sure, but I‚Äôll most likely review that in like 3 weeks when I‚Äôm home & have a chance to look through it. It included some re-buys of items that I have lost (rings that I left behind in a Hostel over February of 2022) and a lot (by that I mean 13) of retro football shirts (thank you AAAAJersey) as it is always a blokecore summer.  Most of these links will be dead links (I‚Äôm sorry) but a few of them do still work, and I‚Äôve linked them where I can.  This is somewhat based off of [u/epicbigc13579‚Äôs](https://old.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/10d855d/long_term_review_of_all_the_rep_items_i_have_ever/) review I found recently. To quote: > ‚ÄúI'll be basing it on a 40 point scale, separated into 4 different categories each weighted 10 points: quality of product, value (if the price was worth paying for), accuracy to the real item, and usage (how much I've worn the item since I got it).‚Äù Also, most of the photos of these will be QCs from ages ago, since I‚Äôve lost/worn through some of the items. Each of these categories will be in chronological order. Some items I‚Äôve bought were so bad that I don‚Äôt really remember/barely wore them, so I won‚Äôt review, or I gave them away to friends/siblings right away, or just donated them after one wear. They won‚Äôt even have links anyways, so don‚Äôt complain. Feel free to ask me about the sizing on these items in the comments as well!  My stats:  Age: 21  Height: 187cm (6‚Äô1.5 or so)  Weight: like 180 lbs i have no fucking idea i have not weighed myself since pre covid i think  Sizing: Usually between L and XL in Tees, M/30-32 Waist in Pants, US 11/44 or 45 in shoes, Ring Sizes are like 9/10 depending on the finger (middle is 10 or 10.5, index is like a 10? and ring is like a 9 maybe)  ##Jackets ###[CJHomme Overcoat 308¬•](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093487021454016582/4379158915870_6_9_9.png?width=1920&height=1440)  [Link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=583224118345)  Quality: 6  Value: 8  Accuracy: 10  Usage: 11  Ah, CJHomme. Most of you tiktok zoomers probably aren‚Äôt aware this brand exists, let alone would think about wearing them. For those who are unaware, CJHomme is a Korean store that does a lot of basics, and has some really nice stuff. Please check them out, but beware of the sizing. I got the largest size possible, and it‚Äôs still a touch small for me in the arms and body. Even then, I wore this coat like every other day basically for two years of uni. I got the unpadded version, and it was pretty thin and required some layering when it was quite cold. It‚Äôs super fashionable and nice though, so I‚Äôd recommend you put it on your list for the preemptive Autumn hauls. Have a look around their store for some really great Korean-style basics.   ###[WTAPS Helly Hansen Jacket 385¬•](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093281085351276594/3516496815368_3_8_2.png?width=2560&height=1440)  Quality: 10  Value: 8  Accuracy: 9  Usage: 3  If I was a techwear wearer, I would love this. It‚Äôs actually really nice, with a detachable hood, and waterproof as well. Unfortunately, I never really wore it, and so I gave it to my brother. I‚Äôm not sure of the actual accuracy, but it seems like it‚Äôs all in order. Also, nobody knows what WTAPS is as a brand so I was never worried about wearing it around. Really nice quality, but just wasn‚Äôt really my style. Weird of me to order it, looking back, but I don‚Äôt really regret it too much.   ###Human Made Hot Dog Varsity 338¬• [Front](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093486665626042419/1097832716187_5_3_3.png?width=1920&height=1440) and [Back](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093486666087411743/1098022916187_3_6_8.png?width=1920&height=1440)  Quality: 6  Value: 5  Accuracy: 9  Usage: 5  Gonna be bold here, but I really don‚Äôt think this is as good as it is reviewed to be. I think this is maybe because of being spoiled with a really nice quality Roots varsity jacket that I thrifted, but for the price, you‚Äôre not getting enough quality. It‚Äôs pretty thin, and the leather itself is not that great. I think the print is really cool, and it‚Äôs a real head-turner. Even then, I‚Äôve had one of the buttons fall off after only around a year and a half, and not wearing it that often. Was a bit disappointed by it, to be honest. Go spend your hard earned money on a good quality vintage varsity jacket at the thrift if you can find one.   &nbsp;  ##Sweaters/Hoodies  ###17 Spring/Summer Palace Splitter Hoodie - 150¬•  Quality: 4  Value: 4  Accuracy: 8‚Ä¶?  Usage: 1  Honestly, this hoodie was pretty dogpiss. I really liked the design, but it was super thin and I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of the price, considering how much you can get for 150 yuan these days. Sold it on BST ASAP after maybe its second wear.  ###Adidas Crewneck 65¬•  Quality: 6  Value: 8  Accuracy: 6 (might be fantasy)  Usage: 5  Wore this a good amount, but it‚Äôs a bit small for me, as I ordered an L. My brother wears it a decent amount now. Super omega dead link though, as I ordered this in August of 2018.   ###UnionKingdom Reverse Weave Champion Hoodies, [Lavender](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093486289862529084/1247501916023_4_2_8.png?width=1920&height=1440), [Dark Green,](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093486289581527071/1926175116023_8_1_0.png?width=1920&height=1440) and [Peach](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093486290172903424/1289659616023_0_3_7.png?width=1920&height=1440) - 188¬• [Link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=562633828776)  Quality: 9  Value: 9  Accuracy: 10  Usage: 9  Real ones remember UnionKingdom as well. These champion hoodies are legit. Super comfortable, super warm, and I‚Äôve compared to my legit Black Champion Hoodie - I‚Äôd say basically identical in feel and fit. I ordered a Lavender one back in my 2nd haul in September of 2018, and then ordered three more for my two siblings as Christmas presents to fight over in October of 2020. Compared to the new Kanye hoodies that everyone seems to be getting, they‚Äôre definitely not as nice, but I‚Äôd recommend getting them nevertheless.   ###[Supreme x Nike Crewneck, Red 169¬•](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093308102314557461/4600516815544_6_4_9.png?width=1920&height=1440)  Quality: 10  Value: 8  Accuracy: 10  Usage: 9  This crewneck is honestly incredible. I got an XL, and it‚Äôs maybe a half size too big (or you could call it oversized). Super nice  quality, and looks awesome. You wouldn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs Supreme unless you looked at the sleeve embroidery. Sadly the link is dead, but maybe someone‚Äôll do it again, or there‚Äôs a link I‚Äôm unaware of. Super comfy, fits really well, looks great, lovely colour. An excellent rep.   ###UnionKingdom Supreme x Champion Hoodie 258¬•  [Link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=557942689700)  Quality: 9  Value: 7  Accuracy: 9  Usage: 8  Sizing on this was a bit weird, and shrunk in the wash, so my mum wears it now. It‚Äôs a super flashy hoodie, not only due to the colour, but also the super loud Supreme print on the back, so I didn‚Äôt wear it that much in 2018/19 due to it being a more Hypebeast era, as I‚Äôm pretty sure it sold for a crazy amount. It‚Äôs super comfy, but is a super flashy piece. Would recommend it, honestly. I‚Äôm more surprised that the UK is still selling it!    ###Ralph Lauren Cable Knit Crewneck, Multiple Colours - 135¬•  Quality: 10  Value: 8  Accuracy: 10  Usage: 10  These are fabulous. Sized up once, and I wear them all the damn time. I have three I wear regularly, but sadly a dead link. Got one for my dad, and I have a bunch of others. You‚Äôll see quite a few at the end in fit pics.   ###Turtleneck, Multiple Colours 79¬• each  [Link](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=563259027681)  Quality: 5  Value: 6  Accuracy: N/A - not a rep  Usage: 4  Sizing is fuuuucked on these. I got the largest size (XXXL) and it‚Äôs still too small for me. For those of you who are small, definitely think it‚Äôs pretty good size wise. But I‚Äôve ordered [this](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=625110401133&spm=1101.1101.N.N.ce95de0) which has come with pretty high reviews. Will compare when it arrives.  They‚Äôre pretty okay turtlenecks, more of a mohair/wool type situation rather than something more like acrylic or the like. Decently soft, and pretty comfy. My mum wears them now, and she really likes them.   ###Palace Adidas 2014 Crewneck 250¬•  Quality: 5  Value: 3  Accuracy: 8 - i think this maybe is fantasy‚Ä¶?  Usage: 6  My brother wears this now, as it‚Äôs a bit too small. Weird feeling sweater, especially considering the price. I‚Äôve had nicer retail crewnecks for sure, but it looks pretty cool.    ###[Topstoney 18SS Crewneck 180¬•](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093306613240180796/6182729915359_5_1_2.png?width=2560&height=1440)  Quality: 9  Value: 8  Accuracy: 10  Usage: 8  Topstoney the GOAT. An excellent crewneck that I got back in late 2018. Ironically now that I‚Äôm in the UK, I don‚Äôt really wear it much, but my brother has repossessed a lot of my crewnecks. Still, a really nice piece. Dead link, but I think TopStoney may still have a store where you can buy something like this one. Not sure though. Accuracy seems pretty good, from what I can tell compared to retail, and I got a good badge (I believe). I‚Äôm not that fussed though, wear with confidence, and always get the badge in. Bosh.   &nbsp;  ##Tees  ###[Nelly Blank Tee (have bought multiple), now 8¬•](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093251763940884644/3244204215336_5_3_1.png?width=2560&height=1440)  [link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=526937341226&spm=1101.1101.N.N.7e749a4)  Quality: 8  Value: 10  Accuracy: 10  Usage: 10  Honestly, I can‚Äôt really say much about these aside from the fact that they‚Äôre fucking exceptional blank tees. The length on them is a bit weird, but for the price, you‚Äôre getting a thick tee. Just buy some, if only to go under hoodies and tuck into your pants. It's literally like just over 1 USD to get a blank tee. Just do it.   ###Wtaps Tees, in [Mustard Yellow](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093253200011862076/3006348915328_9_7_4.png?width=2560&height=1440) and [Navy](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093253200393547826/3028577115328_7_4_7.png?width=2560&height=1440) 79¬• each  Quality: 8  Value: 8  Accuracy: 9 - i mean its WTAPS i have never seen anyone IRL wear this so i am fearless for getting called out lmao  Usage: 8  Honestly, I got a lot of use out of these tees, considering I‚Äôve had them for almost 4y now. I don‚Äôt really wear them much, but they‚Äôre a pretty good quality blank.   ###Patagonia Tees, in [Yellow](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093306739396464802/0140319115331_3_0_1.png?width=2560&height=1440) and [Navy](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093306738867961856/9488961815330_6_2_7.png?width=2560&height=1440) 29¬•  Quality: 5  Value: 6  Accuracy: 5 - i think this a fantasy item  Usage: 4 Dead link, and pretty dead tees. Not the worst quality blank, but the sizing is all weird. The Navy one also looks dogshit cuz of the way the print looks. Wore the yellow one on the day I shaved my head. They‚Äôre fine tees, but not that good.    ###Kith Tees, [Sand](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093253376403308544/6107885415327_6_6_0.png?width=2560&height=1440) and [Navy](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093253375744819321/5799000915327_3_5_7.png?width=2560&height=1440) 99¬• each  Quality: 8  Value: 8  Accuracy: 9  Usage: 7  By the time you get to the third double purchase of tees in a yellow/brown and navy colour, you‚Äôd think I have a theme in terms of what I like to wear. I can neither confirm nor deny these allegations. Ordered these back in August of 2018 as well. They‚Äôve had a good life, and look really cool. Kith is still pretty niche, and looks good. Dead link, obvi.   ###UK Supreme Morton Salt 99¬• [Link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=2013.1.20141001.2.1f7dc4bcZFeHQj&id=586307833741)  Quality: 9 Value: 8 Accuracy: 10 Usage: 9  This tee is really cool - most people don‚Äôt realise it‚Äôs Supreme unless they take a close look. UK is honestly one of the OG Goats for us Repfam, and this tee is one of those pieces that was highly requested before it got made. Pretty good quality blank, and fits TTS.   ###Chelsea 18/19 [Home](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093487844045111336/2418666515425_9_4_4.png?width=2560&height=1440) & [Away](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093487843676000256/2477824215425_3_5_4.png?width=2560&height=1440) 90¬• each  Quality: 5  Value: 8  Accuracy: 7  Usage: 8  Pretty decent quality football kits, but the numbers did come off right away in a hot laundry load that I accidentally did. AAAAJersey sucks for refunding etc. but they do decent quality stuff. I‚Äôd still recommend going for DHGate over them for single jerseys. I‚Äôll have more to say about their jersey quality when my 13 kits arrive with my next haul.    ###Random Tees from ‚ÄúMr Kirin Studio‚Äù - ~65¬• per Tee [Store Link](https://goodesign.world.taobao.com/shop/view_shop.htm?spm=2013.1.1000126.3.768c1d73ekxZF1)  Quality: 9  Value: 9  Accuracy: N/A (not reps)  Usage: 4  Actually, these are pretty good. Nice quality blanks, and some fun prints. I‚Äôd recommend you all check out the store to get some tees that aren‚Äôt what a FashionReps NPC wears. I don‚Äôt really wear them much these days, and I‚Äôd recommend sizing up a bunch based on their sizing charts. I don‚Äôt wear them much these days, but they‚Äôre still nice and fun graphic tees. Do check the store out!  ###Yeezus Tees 39¬• [Link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=553778141441)  Quality: 5  Value: 8  Accuracy: 8  Usage: 4  Repfam staple, not sure I can say much more than what‚Äôs been said. They‚Äôre cheap, and not the best quality blanks, but they‚Äôre really cool tees. Got one in [black](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093305777323786261/1151458715361_0_4_2.png?width=2560&height=1440) & [white](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093305777697083403/1145784515361_7_8_8.png?width=2560&height=1440) respectively.   &nbsp;  ##Shirts   ###‚Äú2017 summer men's short-sleeved flower shirt‚Äù 78¬•  Quality: 8   Value: 8  Accuracy: 10  Usage: 6   Got two of these, one in [red](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093252529585918042/1699136115311_8_7_3.png?width=2560&height=1440) & one in [blue](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093252529116160220/1695361115311_9_4_5.png?width=2560&height=1440). Made of a weird Rayon material I think? Pretty good shirts, I‚Äôve got a few good wears in the summer. Dead link (sorry), which I‚Äôm surprised about since they‚Äôre more wholesale than a proper ‚Äúrep‚Äù.   ###[Rhude Marlboro 249¬•](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093306044182188142/9190691915687_0_7_8.png?width=1920&height=1440)  Quality: 9  Value: 8  Accuracy: 7  Usage: 10  Ahh, my favourite shirt that I [own](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093262235608035389/C76050C2-1F1D-46D3-A5DF-775F4DB19AE1_1_105_c.jpeg?width=1096&height=1462). Sorry about the dead link, but this is honestly such a great shirt. Material is awesome, the print is great, and it looks so dope. Gets me loads of attention any time I wear it out, and I constantly get compliments on it. It had no tags on it, so I‚Äôve docked a few points, but it‚Äôs really not important. Maybe someone will make this again. Even then, there‚Äôs some great Prada shirts that are being repped that are out there, so don‚Äôt lose hope for your summer fits.    ###[Rhude Flamingo 115¬•](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093305853693673564/1954594315653_6_7_0.png?width=1920&height=1440)  Quality: 7  Value: 9  Accuracy: 9  Usage: 4  Another dead link. I sized up once on this, and I regret it. It‚Äôs fucking massive (already oversized), but looks really cool. Big fan, but I hate how it says RHUDE on the [back](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093305854037590016/1960117715653_8_2_6.png?width=1920&height=1440) in big lettering. Still, a good quality shirt that I wear a decent amount in summer.   &nbsp;  ##Shorts/Pants  ###Palace Adidas Shorts 85¬•  Quality: 7  Value: 6  Accuracy: 7  Usage: 3  For the price, these are pretty good. Even then, I‚Äôve had them for ages and don‚Äôt wear them much. Mostly around the house, since they‚Äôre sweatshorts. I think they‚Äôre not great in terms of accuracy, and the zipper is a bit weird. But they light up when you shine a light at them, so somewhat useful for going out at night? I‚Äôm not even sure they‚Äôre a real collab item, but oh well.   ###Raptors Basketball Shorts 55¬•  Quality: 6  Value: 8  Accuracy: 5  Usage: 2  I think these are meant to be sort of reps of the Just Don shorts? But they‚Äôre kinda shit, and have no pockets, so I don‚Äôt really wear them out much. Not bad shorts by any means. Pretty good for the price tho.   ###Patagonia Shorts 68¬•  Quality: 9  Value: 9  Accuracy: 8  Usage: 10  Man, these shorts are great. Sadly the link is dead, but  these are my summer staples. I honestly live in these when it‚Äôs warm enough to wear. Great fit, ginormous pockets, and not super long. Wish they were still around, but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other sellers that do them.   &nbsp;  ##Socks/Underwear  ###[Palace Socks, 10.5¬•](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093488943237967974/9424243915121_4_2_4.png?width=822&height=1462)  Quality: 6  Value: 6  Accuracy: 8  Usage: 7  Kinda thin, kinda small. Dead link, but they were just kinda fine. Wore them a good amount of times before they got worn through.   ###NoPhone Calabasas Socks in [Black](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093488641319370782/3836423915362_1_4_9.png?width=2560&height=1440), [Beige](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093488641726230538/3830770515362_1_7_1.png?width=2560&height=1440), and [Grey](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093488640853819432/9062025215362_3_2_8.png?width=2560&height=1440)   Quality: 6  Value: 6  Accuracy: 9  Usage: 5  Pretty decent socks, but they were a bit small. Dead link, but I think I found another one [here](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=570217911937) that I think is decent? Not sure 100% tho. They were quite thick when I wore them, nice socks overall.  ###[HanSolo Burberry Briefs - 63¬• for 3](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093304316225388664/0083392815871_5_8_0.png?width=1920&height=1440)  Quality: 5   Value: 6  Accuracy: 5  Usage: 9  Unfortunately you do not get any fit pics of these, as I‚Äôve worn through them. Sad, I know. They fit a bit small (I ordered an L), but were good when I had them.   &nbsp;  ##Shoes   ###[Common Projects Achilles Low 298¬•](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093489756375097375/8310112616024_5_3_5.png?width=1920&height=1440) [Link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=547276651722)  Quality: 7  Value: 5  Accuracy: 6  Usage: 8  I do not want to be on a list, so I will not make the brand into its short form. These did end up eventually getting a hole in the sole after around a year and a half of decently heavy use, so I can‚Äôt really rate them too highly. They‚Äôre pretty uncomfortable, even after you break them in, and the laces aren‚Äôt the same waxed ones on retail. Still, they‚Äôre a really pretty shoe and I‚Äôd recommend picking them up as a more formal staple shoe for summer.   ###Common Projects Suede Chelsea Boot 398¬•  [Link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=564097158828)  Quality: 10  Value: 7  Accuracy: 9  Usage: 10  I adore these shoes, and they‚Äôre still a staple in my closet to this day. One of my most EVER used Rep Purchases. I have them in the [Taupe](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093303831665848430/1447264216175_7_5_6.png?width=1920&height=1440) and [Tobacco](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093303832009785404/3243843816175_2_0_8.png?width=1920&height=1440). They fit TTS, just as an FYI. Get these shoes, if you are the kind of person who is a bit more fancy in how they dress and want some chelsea boots.   ###[Versace Slides 88¬•](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093490055772901416/8099450915683_6_7_0.png?width=1920&height=1440)  Quality: 9  Value: 10  Accuracy: 7  Usage: 10  Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôve gotten so much use out of these slides. I‚Äôve worn these all the time after getting them in October of 2019, and at uni I wore them genuinely every day from 2020 onwards, both in and out of the shower/bathroom and my room. It was only in December of 2022 that one of the soles separated and needed glueing, and they‚Äôre still going on strong. Sadly, yet another dead link (I mean, it‚Äôs been like 3.5 years), but these are an underrated staple.    ###[Jordan I Court Purple](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093481951375130726/7862440515547_5_3_9.png?width=1920&height=1440) 168¬•  Quality: 7  Value: 10  Accuracy: 7  Usage: 5  For the price, I‚Äôm pretty happy with these court purples. Not an expert by any means on how accurate they are, but I‚Äôve got a good amount of use out of them. Kinda hard to pair with outfits though is the only thing I‚Äôve found.   &nbsp;  ##Accessories  ###[Acne Studios Ring 28¬•](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=529489820114&spm=1101.1101.N.N.8baf4af)  Quality: 8  Value: 8  Accuracy: 9 Usage: 3  This has a more burnished steel look rather than a more silver look that a lot of my other rings have had, so I don‚Äôt really wear this much. It‚Äôs a nice ring, I might try to give it to a friend or something.    ###Palace Flip Ring 32¬•  Quality: 6  Value: 5  Accuracy: 7  Usage: 2  Kinda forgot I had this, plus because I don‚Äôt wear Gold Jewelry, this never really got worn. I think it‚Äôs somewhere at home.    ###MF Doom Ring  [Link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=556860643553&spm=1101.1101.N.N.28bf063)  Quality: 1  Value: 5  Accuracy: N/A idk its not a rep?  Usage: 1  Made my finger green. SHIT!!! Do not buy.  &nbsp;  Before I go over the next 7 rings, I want to say that I would still be wearing them today if I was not a big stupid idiot who left them behind in a hostel after taking them off overnight and realised on his flight home. I would wear all of them daily, until I left them behind, which is why the usage is all 10. You can see them all [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093262236807598100/F7279892-AF35-4DCD-ACF2-F77F840CE545_1_105_c.jpeg), as well as [here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093305151122579576/Screenshot_2023-04-05_at_23.43.38.jpg?width=1040&height=1462) and [here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093305151483285574/Screenshot_2023-04-05_at_23.43.54.jpg?width=904&height=1460).   ###Gucci Ghost Ring 95¬•  Quality: 10  Value: 8  Accuracy: 9  Usage: 10  Sadly, dead link, but this ring was great when I had it. Definitely 925 Sterling Silver, and looked really nice. Subtle flex, for those who noticed. I don‚Äôt want to harp too much on it, since it‚Äôs a dead link.   ###SLP Chain Ring 60¬• when I first bought (now 80¬•)  [Link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=546574057045&spm=1101.1101.N.N.beb98f1)  Quality: 10  Value: 9  Accuracy: 10  Usage: 10  I believe this is a fantasy piece, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a gorgeous ring. It‚Äôs 925 Silver, and looks great. I ordered it back in April of 2020, lost it somewhere, ordered it AGAIN in spring of 2021, and then left it at the hostel in 2022. I‚Äôve ordered it again in my latest haul, just because I think it‚Äôs a great simple ring that has a lot of nice detailing. If you‚Äôre looking for good accessories, please do get this one. Sizing is Chinese Sizing, fwiw.    ###Silver Feathers Ring 74¬•  [Link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=548715143836&spm=1101.1101.N.N.17324c0)  Quality: 3  Value: 2  Accuracy: 10  Usage: 8  The band at the bottom of this was super flimsy and snapped after a few months of wearing. Pretty ring, and looked nice, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. I think the store it‚Äôs from has a lot of cool stuff tho.    ###Gold Feather Ring 32¬•  [Link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=589326371115&spm=1101.1101.N.N.481f39e)  Quality: 8  Value: 10  Accuracy: 10 - not a rep  Usage: 10  This ring is really dope - simple, looks really good, and is stainless steel so you won‚Äôt get green fingers. For the price, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a no brainer to pick up. Seriously, I got so many more compliments on this compared to my Gucci/SLP ring. Simple accessory that just goes crazy.   ###Stainless Steel Twist Ring 25¬•  [Link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=592342512479&spm=1101.1101.N.N.caa5e7d)  Quality: 8  Value: 9  Accuracy: 10 - not a rep  Usage: 10  Pretty good ring, it‚Äôs Stainless Steel but feels quite high quality. Annoyed to have lost it, but it‚Äôs nothing special. Would recommend it, if you‚Äôre looking to add more rings to your fits. The store it‚Äôs from has a load of rings, so I‚Äôd recommend checking that out,  ###Gucci Tiger Ring 108¬•  Quality: 10  Value: 8  Accuracy: 10  Usage: 10  Honestly, this ring is fucking excellent. I wish it wasn‚Äôt a dead link. It‚Äôs quite flashy, and I wore it all the time quite proudly, as it looked super cool.   ###Ace Ring 32¬•  [Link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=574066608772&spm=1101.1101.N.N.838b4cf)  Quality: 7  Value: 9  Accuracy: 10 - not a rep  Usage: 10  This is a Stainless Steel Ring, and I think it‚Äôs really nice. The Black paint on the inside of the Ace came off after a few months of wear, but I think it‚Äôd be easy enough to fix with a Sharpie or something, maybe. It‚Äôs a pretty cool ring, and quite fat. The store has a lot of good stuff too.  ###[Hermes Belt 29¬•](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=557811120075&spm=1101.1101.N.N.6b20a11)  Quality: 4  Value: 6  Accuracy: 2  Usage: 8  Another bold review from Servalarian here going against some of the more traditional repfam grain - this belt is pretty shit. I mean, for the price, it‚Äôs great, but there‚Äôs a key flaw that is [not present](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/8hEAAOSwjzJa7PcU/s-l1600.jpg) on retail, that makes you have to flip the belt inside out to look legit due to the white stitching on this one. I mean, most people on the street won‚Äôt know it‚Äôs fake Hermes, but it‚Äôs an instant callout. I‚Äôve worn it a lot, mostly due to a lack of belts, and I‚Äôve been wearing it a lot recently, just cuz my other belt broke. Recently ordered a black & brown version of [this](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=658554308649&spm=1101.1101.N.N.c30eea9) belt, so I‚Äôll be sure to update when my haul comes in.   Aooko Clubmaster ‚ÄúMatte Tortoise Ice Blue Flash‚Äù 120¬• Quality: 9 Value: 9 Accuracy: 10 Usage: 8 I had one pair of these, which I broke, so I ordered another. They‚Äôre great sunglasses, and I‚Äôve never been called out for them. Aooko is usually really good, and for the price, it‚Äôs a no-brainer IMO. I think he has a Yupoo to order from, since the link I used is dead.   &nbsp;  ##Misc  ###[Retro Spoof Food Stickers](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093256078894043136/TB2TWarzRyWBuNkSmFPXXXguVXa_2165666426.png?width=1462&height=1462)  Quality: 10  Value: 10  Accuracy: 10   Usage: 9  These are honestly really fucking funny, and I wish I hadn‚Äôt put so many of them on my old laptop. I wish I could order them again, just cuz there‚Äôs a few I really like. There‚Äôs also a few which are really weird, but these were a fun purchase I saw after someone linked them. Sad to say they‚Äôre gone forever.  ###[Goyard Passport Holder - 70¬•](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093246657887486023/1093304612741730314/4915405415869_6_8_2.png?width=1920&height=1440)  Quality: 7  Value: 9  Accuracy: 8? Idk it looks fine to me  Usage: 8  Doesn‚Äôt really feel like leather? But it‚Äôs sturdy enough, I‚Äôve used it to carry one of my two passports (not to flex too hard) pretty often and never been called out. Fits a passport well, and looks good and is good.    ###UNHS Supreme Key 2017 Knife 12¬• Quality: 8  Value: 10  Accuracy: 8  Usage: 8  Honestly, surprisingly useful (if only to cut open hauls with). Might be illegal where you live, since it‚Äôs a decently large blade & it folds up, so do consider that.   ###Multi Tool Key? 10¬• Quality: 9  Value: 10  Accuracy: 10 (idk man its a multitool what do you want  me to put here)  Usage: 8  This is surprisingly useful. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other variants out there, but having it to open hauls is great.  - - -  ###Overall Favourites Picking favourites is hard, obviously. I think the Rhude Marlboro shirt is one of my favourite items, and gets me the most compliments (sorry for the lack of link). Nelly blanks are probably the most underrated - such good value.  The Common Projects Chelseas are definitely some of my favourites, and I‚Äôd recommend getting them, even if they‚Äôre a bit pricey. Super good quality, and I only replaced them because I beat my other pair to death by wearing them literally every day.  The SLP ring is definitely one I‚Äôd recommend picking up - it‚Äôs 925 silver, and looks dope as all hell, plus it has a matching bracelet in the same store. There‚Äôs a few other rings too. I BEG YOU ALL TO ACCESSORISE WITH RINGS THAT ARENT JUST CHROME HEARTS I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd give any rep piece that I‚Äôve bought a 10/10 honestly. Maybe the Gucci rings which I now cannot re-buy, but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs flaws if you look deep enough in those, and the Nelly Tees have a weird cut. We‚Äôll see if any of the items in my 10-11kg haul are perfect tens - I‚Äôm hoping the Kanye hoodie is, but I‚Äôm not sure 100% yet.  ###Conclusions In doing this review, I did not count up how much I have spent on reps. I am thankful for that fact, as I want to stay oblivious. I do not have a shopping addiction, I just like saving money.  I will leave you all with a few fit pics, of which I‚Äôve tried to get as many reps in as possible. If i‚Äôm gonna be honest, my closet has diverted away from reps a lot in recent years, just by virtue of thrifting, but I‚Äôve still got a few core staples in my wardrobe.

Reps are some of the best building blocks for outfits - the prices you can get on cheap and staple basics to build outfits around are, frankly, unbeatable (for obvious reasons), and I‚Äôd recommend looking out for those, as they‚Äôre timeless for good reasons. There‚Äôs some amazing hype items out there, but they need to be well interspersed with non-hype pieces to make properly good outfits. Some of my favourite fits only have one or two rep pieces, while some outfits are entirely more muted basic reps with a few hype pieces mixed in. Accessories are some of the best ways you can step up your outfits, and I‚Äôd recommend looking at some of the stores of the rings that I have linked in order to get more Stainless Steel/Silver pieces.   I‚Äôm not sure if this remains an adage for this sub, but wearing with confidence is honestly the easiest way to ‚Äúget away‚Äù with wearing reps. I‚Äôve only ever been called out once, which was by another RepFam at my uni, and that was because of the 29¬• Hermes belt that he recognised. Otherwise, I continue to rock more niche brands or things that aren‚Äôt easily observable, which I think maybe helps, but generally you‚Äôre usually good for callouts. Don‚Äôt be afraid to tell people your clothes are reps, but I don‚Äôt really go out advertising it to people (but that‚Äôs just my call).    Anyways, you‚Äôre welcome for the five thousand words I wrote in a few hours in a more classic review format. Another review is coming soon‚Ñ¢, if I get around to it. Please let me know if you have any questions, or want any higher quality photos of some of the items (if I still have them around), or want to know about some of the non-Rep items in some of my fits. Thank you all.;;Wow. 10/10 comprehensive list","{upvote:2,timestamp:2023-04-06}",Reddit,1,1

"Nike,LV,Hermes,Gucci,Uniqlo,Ralph Lauren","quality,price,haul,aesthetic","First ever 8kg haul to Canada - CDG, RL, Yeezy, Nike, Travis Scott This is my first time ever order so I might have gone a bit ham. I can't really comment on how close to retail most of these are but I'll comment on the fit and finish and give an overall rating based on how happy I am with them. # Agent: Pandabuy I'm pretty happy with using Pandabuy. I had some hiccups in the ordering process which were quickly handled. I bought the wrong sizes for the Yeezy slides for my sister's friend and the exchange process was pretty straight forward. Additionally, one of the items I ordered was taking a really long time to come and they cancelled it no questions asked. They also notify you if a seller doesn't offer after-sales service before you confirm purchase which was a really nice disclaimer. Will definitely be using them in the future. The only complaint I have is that it couldn't find the links for many 1688 links but that's not my biggest concern at the moment.  #Parcel - Shipping: Canada PD Line-B to Vancouver - Time: 13 days - Weight: 8 kg - Declared: 14 USD (total) - Cost: 165.90 USD - Insurance: 16.49 USD - Added services: moisture bag and corner protection  [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/KHTdQ2k)  Overall pretty happy with the time and condition. I thought it was taking a bit of time clearing customs which had me stressing but I think it was mostly cause of the long weekend.   [Junior inspector was thorough with his inspection. Senior inspector was thoroughly uninterested.](https://imgur.com/a/hKZPpMo)  #Stats - Height: 5'10 - Weight: 200lb - Shoe size: 9 - Shirt size: L/XL - Pant size: 32W/30L  #Items ##Shoes ###Nike Dunks Panda VT batch - 5/5 $28.36 | [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4968759438&spider_token=4572) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/PQxYpPF)  The leather feels really good and smooth and I don't notice any blemishes. Though I haven't felt the M batch in hand, I don't see a reason to spend extra for this specific CW. Go TTS.  ###Nike AJ1 High Travis Scott FK batch - 4.5/5 $61.19 | [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=5898001095&spider_token=4572) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/YBcJVJ3)  The suede and leather on these feels really good. I love the details that differentiate it from the regular AJ1 including the reverse swoosh, emblem on the back, and cactus jack on the side. If you look very closely the edges of the panels do look a bit rough but it's hardly noticeable unless you're looking at it through a microscope. My biggest complaint with these is that the different laces are different sizes. I wanted to rock one black one pink but it looks odd cause the pink's significantly shorter and doesn't make it to the last eyelet. Go TTS.  ###Yeezy Slides LW batch - N/A $14.93 | [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4406017001&spider_token=4572) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/B3M8pkD)  Didn't want to rate these because I ordered the wrong sizes. I ordered Flax in size 11 for myself and Onyx and Pure for my sister's friend in size 8 since the page said order two sizes up. These are way too big. I think I will order them again and go TTS cause the size 8 pair fits better on me though it is a bit tight. I would suggest anyone else to go TTS. Otherwise, visually, they look great. The plastic is pretty soft. They add a couple inches to my height which I wasn't expecting from slides. Go TTS.  ###Nike AF1 - 5/5 $23.88 | [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4886458512&spider_token=4572) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/iZu7Y5n)  These are for my sister. Not sure what batch they are. Her comments: > 5 ig   > nothinh wrong with them  Go TTS.  ###Nike Dunks VT batch - 5/5 $28.36 | [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4886458512&spider_token=4572) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/40g4fOt)  These are for my sister as well. I don't know if this is a special collab or what the CW is but she liked them. The box says Summit White/Phantom-Cinnabar but a google search didn't give me anything. Same comments as before. Go TTS.  ##Bottoms ###KUYIOU Lifetime pleats pants (Issey Miyake dupe) - 4.75/5 $29.55 | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=613284734010) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/uzMwad0)  No complaints from me on this. The pleats look really good and it fits well on me. Some details I didn't notice in the QC photos are that it has belt loops as well as a button fly with a single button. Not sure what that button is going to do but it's there ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The elastic sometimes twists itself inside the waist which I found a bit strange but it can be easily remedied by just twisting it back.  I went with size M and when wearing it right at the waist it breaks right after the ankle. I wouldn't wear it any lower but if you wear it a bit higher it'll definitely have a cropped look.  ##Tops ###KUYIOU Lifetime pleats polo - 3/5 $32.69 | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=613035029302) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/kQXVjSK)  I would definitely rate this higher if the price wasn't so high. Overall, I like the look of the shirt but considering the price there are some issues with the pleats in the back (see last image) which I can't overlook. I It's a shame cause I really love the overall aesthetic of the shirt otherwise. Looking back at the QC photos the blemishes are there so it's partly my fault for not noticing it. I'd still recommend this shirt just take a good look at your QC photos.  I got a size M which has a regular fit. If you like a bit more oversized size up.  ###CDG Play cardigan from [Repsbrothers](https://repsbrothers.x.yupoo.com/albums) - 5/5 $55.22 | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=693030481300) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/1dixODs)  This is probably my favourite item from this haul. I've wanted this cardigan since high school. The stitching is really high quality and the buttons have a subtle pearlescent shine which looks great. I got a size XL and it's got a regular fit. Definitely size one up for a regular fit or two up for a baggy fit with these.  ###CDG Play striped long sleeve from [Repsbrothers](https://repsbrothers.x.yupoo.com/albums) - 4.9/5 $25.37 | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=693555663273) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/fPovqUO)  The only issue I have with this is that the arms are a bit short but I do have proportionally longer arms but it's very minor. Same deal as the cardigan in terms of sizing.  NOTE about Repsbrothers: I tried to buy the half heart T-shirt from them and it ended up being OOS after I purchased. They automatically refunded me without having to say anything which I was really happy with. ~~They don't offer after sales service otherwise so take that as you will.~~ /u/Repsbrothers just responded and said they do offer after sales service. This might have been a weird automated message or something from Pandabuy.  ###Ralph Lauren corduroy bear button down from [Husky](https://husky-reps.x.yupoo.com/) - 4/5 $20.60 | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=702570647674) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/WlCkzS4)  I'd say for the price, this is a bit much. I expected this to be thicker (like the [Uniqlo corduroy work shirt](https://www.uniqlo.com/ca/en/products/E450266-000?colorCode=COL35&sizeCode=SMA003)). Other than that, it's pretty nice. I got a size L and I wish I had sized up for a more oversized look.  NOTE on Husky: I'm pretty disappointed with the shipping times. It took over a week for all my items to come and I didn't get any updates while I waited. The items were stuck on the purchased stage (not even seller sent) and then just appeared at the warehouse. I ordered another item from him that had no updates for over 2 weeks and I ended up just cancelling it. I understand there may be shipping delays but I expect updates regarding them.  ##Accessories ###Ralph Lauren teddy bear beanie from [Husky](https://husky-reps.x.yupoo.com/) - 3.5/5 $11.34 | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=684517642773) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/BdeyoJn)  I thought it would be smaller like a fisherman's beanie. It does fit nice and snug and is quite warm. I really like the embroidered bear :). Low rating is mostly cause I feel like this could be cheaper to be honest. Additionally this took like 1.5 weeks to get to the warehouse.  ###Ferragamo belt - 5/5 $33.58 | [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4671968267&spider_token=4572) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/xF8CEXn)  This is probably tied as my favourite item from this haul. I like that the buckle is a bit more subtle and not as in your face compared to other designer belts. Love that it's reversible. The leather has a tumbled look and has a very soft feel; it's not super rigid. Oddly enough, it comes with a receipt from Hong Kong?? It also comes with a cloth bag and a [leather hole punch](https://leathersmithdesigns.com/product_images/uploaded_images/craftool-round-drive-punch-size-1.jpg).  The sizing on the page is kinda weird ngl. It's not a big issue cause you can cut it yourself since the buckle is removable. I just went at it with kitchen shears. I got the 105 ohm cause I measured my waist with a tape measure and that's what it suggested. I'd definitely go for a smaller size next time cause I had to hack off like a solid 5-7 cm.  I will definitely consider them in the future if I want another designer belt since they have lots of other options including Gucci, LV, Hermes, etc.  #Closing remarks I know this review's kinda long but I wanted to be thorough for others. Also for any other nervous first timers, I'd say go for it and make sure to read the damn guide. It's very thorough and answers almost any question you can possibly have. If after that you still have questions feel free to ask me.  Will definitely be doing this again -- I'm already putting together another haul for around Christmas.  [Inspectors enjoyed the haul too :)](https://imgur.com/a/0qNYDpk);;just to make sure I prepare for my first haul. for an 8kg package you only declared $14 USD to customs?","{upvote:1,timestamp:2023-09-20}",Reddit,0,

Started in 2014, FashionReps has grown to become a leading community in the world-wide movement towards purchasing goods from China.

Much like how Amazon works with third party sellers, an Agent will do the same. Products will be purchased through your choice of agent (**I recommend** [**PandaBuy**](https://www.pandabuy.com/login?id=1&inviteCode=FashionReps) **due to their unique features & pricing**), sent to a warehouse, pictures taken of the product and uploaded for you to see, then shipped to you after payment.  The main website used by the community is [Taobao.com](https://taobao.com/) and [Weidian.com](https://weidian.com/). Think of it like Amazon or eBay for China - solely for China. The problem that results in is that we need to establish a connection between your country and China. This is where an Agent comes into play.  You browse through your favorite Taobao shops and find some items you want to buy. Now you do not buy it through Taobao but through your agent (in our case, PandaBuy). PandaBuy now buys this exact item and lets it deliver to their warehouse. You ask for pictures, measurements, exchanges, returns etc. When everything is fine PandaBuy will package everything and deliver it to you. They are the connection between you and many chinese platforms.  # 2. Which agent to use?  The community is filled with many options of agents. Due to this, it's best to understand why specific ones are better than others. Over the years, I have used several agents and many of them have been out-ranked by others due to their lack of features, high shipping prices, and lack of customer support as new agents come along. This is why I highly recommend using PandaBuy. PandaBuy offers the most honest, swift, and most importantly professional customer experience you can get. **They're also creating unique features that no other agent is offering. This is why a majority of the community is starting to move towards PandaBuy.** In this guide I will continue to make examples and tutorials only about PandaBuy's information. I am sorry if you use another agent but just keep PandaBuy in mind when you plan your next haul.  Use any agent you want, there are many out there. However, I *highly recommend* using PandaBuy due to their unique features catered to the replica community and pricing.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # III - The PandaBuy Guide + [Unlimited 5% Signup Bonus](https://www.pandabuy.com/login?id=1&inviteCode=FashionReps)  # 1.

This is a precautionary measure that should be done on all websites, not just China-related sites. Also don't worry about your payment information such as Paypal - You never enter your Paypal email + password on the PandaBuy homepage, it always redirects you to Paypal's official website where you log in as usual. PandaBuy also uses a secure connection between you and them (https).  # 2. Ordering Process - How to order (Image & Text Version)  1.

Find the item you want on Taobao and paste in the link OR if you know the name of your seller, type it into the product navigation bar 3. You will be taken to a page like [this](https://imgur.com/8ijWHrX). Here, PandaBuy translates the color and size options for you, and all you need to do is select the color and size you want. After, you can either **Add to Cart** or **Buy Now**. For this example, we'll assume that the sock is the only thing you want. 4. You will next be taken to [this page](https://imgur.com/lFyiqT9). Here, you have to select your country from the **Choose Destination Country** box, then hit submit to be taken to the payment screen. 5. If you have an existing balance in your PandaBuy account from previous purchases that you have returned, you can use that to buy the product. 6. [Here](https://imgur.com/ViMI1oC), just select Balance or your choice of Payment Processor and pay for your order unless you have an existing balance. Sometimes PandaBuy will not allow you to use PayPal and that is when you need to simply top up your balance instead of doing a direct order with PayPal. 7. Now, just wait until the seller ships his order. Once it arrives in the PandaBuy warehouse, you will receive a notification. 8. Once your product arrives, [hover over your username in the navbar and select My Warehouse](http://i.imgur.com/RSSZ1aR.png).

PandaBuy Unique Features  PandaBuy is set to be different than other agents by creating unique features for the community to use. Below are some of the key features that **made my experience far better and put them a mile ahead of other agents.**  # Taobao Shop Navigation  Navigating directly through their site, not requiring a taobao account.. you can view all the products from a seller.

FashionReps Terminology  **QC:** Quality Control (QC for short) is talking about pictures that are posted from an agent of an item that was ordered. Users will post these if they're unsure about the quality and would rather have someone else take a look at them if they're good enough.  **LC:** Legit Check (LC for short) This is a tag used for posts requiring a legit check. Legit checks are a great way of finding out if a item you're purchasing is authentic or not.  **GP:** Guinea Pig (GP for short) You will be the first person to order a sellers new item. This means you'll be the first to get pictures of their product and often times you'll post them to be checked for quality by the community.  **FIND:** Much like the name states. Posts with this flair are often linked to new products that haven't been posted before.  **W2C:**: Where To Cop (W2C for short) W2C refers to the search for a desired item. Often times will be linked with retail images for an example.  **1:1**: One to One (1:1 for short) 1:1 refers to a perfect replica. However, not many exist and often times you won't be able to get these as they're sold out.  **GL**: Green Light (GL for short) GL Refers to a user who has given their approval of a QC post.  **RL**: Red Light (RL for short) RL Refers to a user who has given their disapproval of a QC post.  **B&S**: Bait & Switch (BS or B&S for short) B&S Refers to a seller who has advertised their product and sent goods that are different from advertised.  2.

Taobao offers a feature called Search via Image. This allows users to easily find items related to the image they upload.  Start here: [https://s.taobao.com/search](https://s.taobao.com/search)?  **Unfortunately, my video guide below would not process on reddit, so please watch this** [**Youtube video.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlFHLITeQsc)  1.

Now find a reasonably priced and good looking product for your needs!  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # VI - How To Avoid Customs  **1. Intro Revised**  Ok this may be the most important part of my Guide. How to avoid customs - especially when you are living in Europe (s/o to Germany). Not everything changed, but there are some IMPORTANT steps that I added to the checklist. DHL is the way to go for Germany, Austria and many more European countries. Do not use EMS in Germany or Austria.  If you live **in the US or Canada you can choose EMS, DHL or GD-Sal.** Customs are pretty relaxed in these countries. For the US and Canada, shipping hauls up to 10kg generally isn't a problem. Some people even do more. Do so at your own risk. For the USA, the declaration value doesn't matter much, as you are unlikely to be taxed. For Canada, declare the package 10-14USD. Also, If you live in Canada, it is advised that you use EMS or GD-SAL. If you use DHL, you will be taxed upon package arrival.  **2. Checklist For Europe**  You may have to look up laws for any import fees or regulations. These numbers are an example for PandaBuy shipping to Germany, it should work for any country though.  \[ \] Stay within .9 of a KG. [Read here for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/acw6nk/as_requested_a_short_explanation_to_superbuy/)  \[ \] Try to stay at a maximum of 4kg. Do not go over this for the safest rate.  \[ \] If possible ask for no cardboard wrapping, let them package in DHL plastic bag  \[ \] Ask for vacuum sealing (Possible in the fewest cases)  \[ \] Ask them to wrap up your whole package with tape, a lot of tape.  \[ \] Let them put a Commercial invoice on the outside (!)! of your package  \[ \] The commercial invoice should have a value UNDER $24 including shipping costs  \[ \] The commercial invoice has to be readable, if it has printing errors it has to be printed again  \[ \] The commercial invoice has to state the shipping costs with a value >$0  \[ \] The commercial invoice has to have a sender address  \[ \] Your telephone number has to be stated on the commercial invoice  \[ \] Let them send you a copy of the commercial invoice to your email (Will come back to this)  It is strongly advised that you go to Google and type in ""\[Your country\] customs fashionreps"".  **By doing this, you will get a good grasp of what others have done. Trust me, your situation is not unique.**  https://preview.redd.it/9jgai4e05seb1.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&s=61e6472c3f3cff1cadf44894038fb389c20ed102  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # VII - General Tips About PandaBuy/Shipping  * Use [Rehearsel Shipping](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/8n8hq2/how_to_save_money_on_superbuy_shipping/) to avoid paying too much shipping costs * You can ship shoeboxes - Do not ship more than 2 shoeboxes in one package * You can ship as many packages as you want simultaneously (Keep calm tho) * Think twice before shipping shoeboxes, if you don't need them, don't ship them and let PandaBuy throw them away. They're heavy and require volumetric weight. * If you have a non-Rep haul then you can probably use other shipping methods. Decide on your own. * I recommend you to use the service called [17Track](https://www.17track.net/en) to track your packages. No matter the tracking number [17Track](https://www.17track.net/en) usually can decipher it and track it for you. * If PandaBuy does not let you pay for your replicas directly through Paypal, just top up your account balance and then pay through your balance.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # VIII - What Happens When Your Haul Gets Seized By Customs  **Outside of United States**  Keep. The. F\*\*\*. Calm. This can have so many reasons. And I want to correct myself, there is a difference between your parcel is held up by customs and your parcel being seized by customs. Let me take all the fear from you.  If your parcel is held up DHL probably just messaged/emailed/called you and they told you some long story about some value declaration and so on. To keep it short: DHL does not trust your invoice/can't read the invoice/is bored af and wants a proof of payment to declare the value of your haul. For DHL Germany it is really easy to do this. You go to [this DHL Link](https://www.dhl.de/express/dhl4you) fill out the information and upload a Paypal/Bank wire/Western Union/Payment Screenshot. For any other country: Search for the email address of DHL Express Customs (not normal DHL) in your country. You can also call the DHL Express hotline and ask them. Email them the same proof of payment screenshot.  The bad side is that you will probably have to pay some importing fees (EUSt in Germany are 19% + 12,50‚Ç¨ DHL fees). I can tell you that DHL Customs will not check if you send them an authentic screenshot of your Paypal transaction or if you managed to change up some digits in order to stay under $24. To save the importing fees. I cannot tell you how to do it, though of course. Google inspect element... This is why it was important, that PandaBuy sent you the Commercial Invoice they put on the parcel - You know exactly how high they declared it and what they stated is inside.  The Tracking status should be ""Clearance Event"" when they want the proof of payment and should change to ""Clearance processing completed"" when it is done. This can take up to several days after you send them the screenshot.  If your haul really got seized (Tracking status ""Please contact DHL"") there is nothing you can do. DHL will send you a letter where they will ask you for your permission to destroy the items. Just ignore this letter. It will automatically count as a permission (in Germany). There is nothing else. You don't go to jail, you don't get a Million $ fine. Some DHL Customs worker told me that if you stay under 3 shoes per package they will not contact the brand. But keep in mind, this is TOTALLY random. If you follow the checklist there is a micro chance that you package will even get inspected. Because inspecting alone is not enough, so many DHL workers just don't care and pass Nike, Adidas, Gucci Fakes. And if you really are that unlucky, just deal with it. Some sellers send out a replacement for free, some don't. You, Your family and your future kids will be safe, don't worry.  **Inside the United States**  If your package was seized within Chinese borders often times the Agent will refund you the full parcel price. Meaning if your haul went to the value of ¬•2,000 then you will be reimbursed ¬•2,000 directly to your PandaBuy account.  If your package was seized or taken in for inspection by United States Customs then you will be given a call or a notice that DHL, EMS, or your selected shipping company has took in your package. **Do not panic.** Often times when they take your package in for inspection they will ask you to provide a receipt or invoice for the declaration of value for your haul. Seizures and inspections are 100% random and aren't able to bypassed through any method. To keep it short: DHL does not trust your invoice/can't read the invoice/is bored af and wants a proof of payment to declare the value of your haul. For DHL Germany it is really easy to do this. You go to [this DHL Link](https://www.dhl.de/express/dhl4you) fill out the information and upload a Paypal/Bank wire/Western Union/Payment Screenshot. For any other country: Search for the email address of DHL Express Customs (not normal DHL) in your country. You can also call the DHL Express hotline and ask them. Email them the same proof of payment screenshot.  After this step you will need to wait for the review period to end and if everything went well then your package will be released to you. If your package was seized and they send you a letter than it is best to say you didn't order the item and take the loss on the haul.  **This rarely happens.**  # VIII - Useful Links And Seller Stores  Ok this was the Big Customs/FashionReps Newbie Guide/PandaBuy Guide v6.0. If you have any remarks/questions feel free to hit me up. I will add some links that are quite useful and try to update it as often as possible:  * [Use Taobao Image Search](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/6kx1e5/how_to_taobao_image_search_china_taobao/) * [FashionReps Newbie Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/ae540e/guide_help_im_new_where_do_i_start_fashionreps/) * [How to properly measure](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/ae540e/guide_help_im_new_where_do_i_start_fashionreps/) * [Trusted Seller List (Low Risk)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/wiki/trusted) * [How much will my haul cost?](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/hwikz4/how_much_will_my_haul_cost_to_ship_and_other/) * [Massive List of Shops](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/i6r9bp/yupoo_seller_starter_pack_for_the_newbies_and/)  # IX - Typically Weights Of Each Item To Estimate Costs  Credit to reddit user. [/u/125ba](https://www.reddit.com/u/125ba/). Please note these are just averages. Depends on sizing and quality.  https://preview.redd.it/xmq8el4efmcb1.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a3df7c664a47580a4b8519924378b8e8d0c7cb1  # X - How To Make Your Haul Cheaper  You will need to do rehearsal shipping once you have all your items in your warehouse. In short, you pay a small fee (around ¬•20) for someone to package up all of your stuff, weigh it, measure it, and put these figures into the shipping calculator for a final cost.  There are two ways to do rehearsal shipping and you do this from your warehouse in PandaBuy.  1. With PandaBuy, they are more or less spot on with their revised methods of weighing. 2. You can still opt for Rehearsal Shipping but it should not be used every order.  *Typically*, you will see a new reduction by doing this.  # XI - I Shipped, Now Where Is My Parcel?  You wait till it arrives! But here are some FAQ's.  **Q - How long should my parcel take to arrive?**  China Post‚Äôs tracking service documents the average arrival times of all parcels for some frequent countries as follows. If your haul has not arrived and the ‚Äúlongest‚Äù number of days has not elapsed, you should not be concerned.  Country - Average Delivery Time - Longest Time - Shortest Time  * Australia / New Zealand : 12 - 15 - 9 * Canada : 30 - 60 - 10 * EU : 17 - 44 - 7 * United Kingdom : 12 - 40 - 6 * United States : 16 - 62 - 4  As you can see, *a delivery time of 40+ days for Europe and North America is frequent*. (source: China Post)  **Q - What does ‚Äúshipping notice received‚Äù (or similar) mean?**  This means the agent has put a tracking number from China Post on your parcel (i.e. a sticker with a barcode and scanned it), but has not shipped the goods yet. It can take two to three business days for the goods to be shipped as the agent will be waiting for China Post to collect the goods. In most cases, sellers will take immediate action to ship the goods to avoid disputes and reputational damage.  **Q - It's been a couple of days since I finalized my haul, why hasn't anything happened?**  In general, to avoid disappointment you should start counting days from when the parcel is collected (it says this specifically on your agent's site and on 17track) rather than the date you submitted the parcel.  Paying for your parcel today doesn't mean it will be in the hands of China Post tomorrow - it takes time to physically bundle up the parcel, allocate a tracking number and get China Post to physically collect at the warehouse. It can often take two to three business days for this to happen and your haul to update that the tracking number has been activated.  Agents and (more frequently) direct sellers will tell you ""the item has shipped, but the shipping company hasn't given the tracking information yet"" when in reality your parcel is still in the warehouse  **Q - There seem to be a lot of delays, should I ship my parcel now or wait?**  This is similar to driving to a friend‚Äôs house cross-country when the traffic is awful all the time - the sooner you leave, the sooner you‚Äôll get there. Things won‚Äôt be any faster by delaying your haul.  **Q - Has my haul been seized?!**  In all likelihood, no. Your parcel status will update saying it is being inspected by customs at the point of seizure. A lack of status updates is probably a good thing in that sense.  **Q - Is my parcel lost?**  In all likelihood, no. These things are very rare and if you are worried about this happening you should purchase the relevant insurance protection from your agent before finalizing your shipment.  **Q - My parcel has been scanned by customs but it hasn't been updated to say customs has been cleared. Has my haul been seized?**  In all likelihood, no. The scan to confirm the parcel has cleared customs doesn‚Äôt necessarily take place in the warehouse and often takes place while the parcel is being loaded into a lorry or when it arrives at your local sorting office.  **Q - What can I do to hurry things up?**  Literally nothing. This is how international shipping works, so get comfortable with it.

Now with that out of the way let's start the review.   -Triple White/Cream Yeezy 350v2 Size 46  Not much I can say. These are definitely worth the money.

I like the looks of these more than most of my yeezys. The laces are 3m but they are not as quality as the pervious pairs in this list. The primeknit is just the right amount of stretch. Flaw: I have yet to compare to retail and it might be a sizing thing but on the outer side of the shoes right above the heel the primeknit doesn't look the same as pictures I've seen(wrong pattern) [QC Photos](http://imgur.com/a/FqwEjmw) [W2C](https://www.cnfashionpub.com/product/p190-%e9%bb%91%e5%a4%a9%e4%bd%bf-%e6%9c%ac%e5%9c%b0%e7%89%88%e6%a4%b0%e5%ad%90adidas-yeezy-350-boost-v2-black-fu9161/) [In Hand Photos](http://imgur.com/a/rAvT5ce)    -True Form Yeezy 350v2 Size 45  These are my favorite other than the triple black pair.

I looked at the photos from superbuys and ended up shipping. I definitely should have looked harder at the photos. Keep in mind the flaws I'm going to list are for my specific pair. Flaws: First off, the arches of the shoes do not align correctly. The alignment is slight bit when on feet you can tell, it's very annoying. Second, on the right shoe on the toe area there is a ""wave"" in the primeknit that is very noticeable. [QC Photos](http://imgur.com/a/tWPPyd0) [W2C](https://www.cnfashionpub.com/product/p320-%e6%b5%b7%e7%9b%90-%e4%ba%9a%e6%b4%b2%e9%99%90%e5%ae%9a-ad-yeezy-boost-350-v2hyperspaceeg749140/) [In Hand Photos](http://imgur.com/a/aSdrYd3)    -Ultra Boost 1.0 Triple White Size 45  The majority of the primeknit is a pure white but the 1.0 pattern is a cream color and it makes a really nice looking shoe. One of my favorite pair I own. The ankle opening is pretty tight but it's not uncomfortable and helps secure the shoes to your feet. The boost is also very comfortable. All in all a great shoes. Flaws: None that I know of.

There a bit to much wiggle room in them honestly. But there are definitely not bad. Boost is comfy. Flaws: Not sure if you'd consider this a flaw but the primeknit is very stretchy. I've never owned 3.0 so I'm not sure how stretchy it's supposed to be.

They are pretty darn close though.  Edit: Added in hand photos. There not the best but they are the best I could do.;;Having owned retail ub I can say 3.0 is definitely stretchier in the knitting than others. No flaw there imo.

Luckily, they were not compressed and showed up in good condition.  Also, the shipping updates in the app are not as up to date as [parcelsapp](https://parcelsapp.com) or 17track, hopefully they can improve on this factor so we don't have to use other websites to

I didn‚Äôt know at the time I bought and even shipped it out that it was worn by Jason Lee on Drink Champs, so I was going off of reference pictures online and that was it.  - Jacket is made out of denim is surprisingly thick. I haven‚Äôt worn a denim jacket since I was a kid so I might just be missing out, but the heaviness on this is nice and is pretty good for a breezy Spring or Fall day with a tee underneath. Probably won‚Äôt be ideal for anything less than 50¬∞F / 10¬∞C with just a long sleeve/crewneck underneath  - This is definitely oversized, and at my stats with a size 2, I can layer up with an oversized hoodie underneath, and still have some wiggle room. Sizing down once I think would‚Äôve been okay, but I was afraid the arms would be a little short. I find size 2 okay, and don‚Äôt regret sizing up to be safe. However, for potential buyers, if you‚Äôre around my stats, unless you‚Äôre looking for an overly baggy fit, size 1 would be perfect.  - This jacket is supposed to have a washed/distressed look to it, and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs intentional or not, but if you look at the ‚Äòwhite stripes‚Äô on the jacket, it looks like they tossed the jacket on the floor, ran it over a few times, then dragged it across the garage floor before shipping it out to my agent to give it that distressed feel (that or it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs been worn for 12 days by hundreds of people at JFK). In one of the pictures, I had a piece of computer paper next to it for reference. I think washing it should help lighten it up a little if it‚Äôs just from manufacturing, but at the same time, I‚Äôm not too worried about it since after a few washes, it might end up like that anyways if it was pure white. It's a pretty coarse denim, but with wear it‚Äôll definitely soften up. **EDIT:** Washed the jacket, and the white stripes have turned a darker grey after washing it in a cycle of darks. Not bothered by it since it'll be worn and washed, and pretty sure the genuine article would be the same after a few washes anyways.   - The front pockets and inner pocket are zipper lined and have some decent depth. The inner pocket unfortunately doesn‚Äôt have that big of an opening so you can‚Äôt put your whole hand in there, but it can easily fit your phone and you can fish it out easily. Front pockets again are zipper lined, has good depth to it and would help keep your hands out of the cold, and also your small items from falling out. The main zipper is a little stiff and you have to fidget with it a little bit but not a big deal for me.   - The sleeves and waist area look and feel a little weird, but comparing it to pictures online, it‚Äôs actually similar to how they look in retail. They‚Äôre elastic but sort of a stiff elastic and looks like an overly stretched elastic that only really scrunches up at some parts. I might swing by the Balenciaga store on my off day to see if they have it there just to see the real deal myself since I essentially bought this piece blind just going off of pictures online. The embroidery is a little funky, but I‚Äôm not too concerned as long as there‚Äôs no visible thread linking each letter, but I‚Äôll also take a look versus retail.   - **Verdict: 9/10** Overall am satisfied with the purchase. It‚Äôs a great piece for the Spring and Fall, or if you just live in 50-60¬∞F weather year-round as a light jacket. The jacket has weight but it‚Äôs not heavy enough to be a winter jacket by any means (unless you layer up 3-4 layers underneath. Oversized but not overbearing since the ‚Äòelastic‚Äô actually does a good job of cuffing your waist and wrists. I usually pack very light so having additional pockets and even an inner pocket would help lighten the load on my pants. The inner pocket could actually fit a power bank to top up my phone if I need. This piece isn‚Äôt as loud as some of the others from Balenciaga and I appreciate that.  | Fear of God FG Crewneck Sweatshirt (Premium Gray and Camel) | Size: Large | 710g each | Ôø•168 each +Ôø•8 shipping | Singor |[Yupoo](https://steven-1989.x.yupoo.com/albums/101774132?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=3018541) // [TaoBao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=653498860145)| [QC](https://imgur.com/a/B7I0bjM) // [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/7Gh8vZa) // [On](https://imgur.com/a/o5LArHp)| [Sizing Chart](https://i.imgur.com/4VH8rEj.jpg) |  |:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|  - I‚Äôve seen crewnecks with front pockets/pouches before and thought it was pretty novel. I don‚Äôt own any like that and Singor has left a good impression on me his fleece products with the Yeezy sweatpants so I just went for it. They were actually in pre-production when I first ordered it.  - These are slightly to oversized. If you look at the pictures on the Yupoo, the FOG model pic has them wearing a hoodie UNDERNEATH the sweatshirt. I thought maybe during the breezier days, I can probably wear a Gildan crewneck underneath it for something to layer up and skip the jacket, or just wear it lounging around or whatever, so I sized up because of that. I think going down with TTS medium would be a better fit and it‚Äôll be less baggy, but I‚Äôd prefer the baggier fit to have a little more flexibility.  - These crewnecks are fleece lined on the inside, and inside the kangaroo pouch as well, so suffice to say, it‚Äôs going to be warm. I wore the camel crewneck with a long sleeve Uniqlo Heat-Tech underneath and it was great for the 50¬∞F weather even with the breeze. The cuffs at the wrist and waist are a bit loose, probably because of the sizing, but it‚Äôs a more relaxed fit anyways so if you like a tighter cuff, I would go true to size.   - If you look at the neck opening, the sizing is different between the two colors. Not sure if this is intentional or not, but the premium gray one would allow you to wear a hoodie and whatnot underneath since the opening is large enough. The camel one wouldn‚Äôt allow for that and I don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt catch it in the QC pics but I have room to work with when layering now and that‚Äôs fine by me. The premium gray one is also softer to the touch than the camel one as well, but overall, both are soft and comfy.  - **Verdict: 9/10** Something new to me, but still playing it safe. It‚Äôs still a bit chilly here so it came in just in time to be worn a few more times before the tee shirt weather hits. For the price, it‚Äôs more than worth it (I would buy it as blanks as well for the same quality too if Singor sold it as it is). Assuming this applies to each and every gray piece Singor makes, I would recommend the premium gray colorway any day just for how soft it is to the touch, even softer than the camel one.    #The RL  | Balenciaga Denim Nylon Jacket | Size: 38 | 727g | Ôø•459 +Ôø•10 shipping | Cloyad | [Yupoo](https://cloyad0809.x.yupoo.com/albums/100441225?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=3687672) // [TaoBao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=649862622296) | [QC](https://imgur.com/a/HeFqBuc) | [Sizing Chart](https://i.imgur.com/crEEfOz.jpg) | |:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|  - Originally, I wanted to get this piece from Cloyad, but the lockdown threw a wrench in that plan and he removed it from his Yupoo and was sold out. They came back in stock and I went with one but was disappointed.   - Obvious flaws right off the bat for me was the fact that the N and C are far from the zipper lining for the logo. It‚Äôs also pretty obvious too from a distance since the letters are on white. The second is that the logo isn‚Äôt centered. If you look at the shot with the ruler, you can see it‚Äôs drifting down.   - Not sure how these were before the lockdown, but considering Cloyad is one of the better choices for Balenciaga, this was disappointing. His size chart did not look it does now, and it looked just like Rick‚Äôs size chart and stock photos. Coincidentally both of them dropped this jacket from their Yupoo page at the same time, and Rick hasn‚Äôt added it back to his Yupoo, so I‚Äôm leaning towards them using the same source for the jacket, and Cloyad is now using a different source that‚Äôs not up to par with his previous source.;;Fit pic Jacket","{upvote:1,timestamp:2022-05-09}",Reddit,0,

I paid $152 shipped to the Uk, and I can say it‚Äôs worth every penny.   **SIZING**  These fit pretty true to size, follow the size guide jelly provides to check what you need. These are a UK10, which is a 44 or a 10G for LV sizing.  **CUSTOMER SERVICE**  Jelly‚Äôs customer service is the best of any rep seller or service I have ever used. He is so polite and he speaks amazing English so it is very easy to communicate. He also doesn‚Äôt throw you straight in with the ‚ÄòPay here‚Äô etc, he actually gives you good information and help about the shoe and the sizing.  *Overall I am incredibly happy with these shoes.

Me: 188 cm/ 108 kg  Her: 160 cm / 88 kg  Anyway me and my wife are fat.  Buying stuff here in Asia is rough, so I turned into reps. Now I look hot, she looks hot and life is great. Thanks for all the Repfam for all the support, and now it is my turn to give back! W2C and QC Pics are all in the imgur links. Sorted by category.  Anyway if this post is like too TL;DR to you, then here's the key takeaways:  * Best purchases: BAPE X Coach jacket, Ambush pill necklace, GDC shirts, Calabasas pants, WTG/158sir shoes. * Biggest surprise: Versace bling bling chain. I expected something more tacky, but it's actually p. decent! AND IT SPINS! * 158Sir takes like 2-3 weeks to ship to the warehouse, but the quality is really top-notch. I know I got pissy at him at first, but once you get the shoes, they really do feel next level! WTG shoe is also great. * T-shirt reps are soooo hit and miss, like... seriously... Reps are better bought in not t-shirt form. * Wearing cool shoes will get you attention from sneakerheads only... I wish some girls would gush out smth like ""Hey those AJ1 SBB 3.0s are like soooo coool where did you get those."" but no it's always some thin with glasses going all fours, touching the freaking leather and saying ""Yo these are reps!!!""

"Nike,Adidas,Burberry,Ralph Lauren","quality,price,haul","4,2 kg CSSBuy haul to germany via JW-Tariffless: St√ºssy Tees, Polo Ralph Lauren pants, Adidas Yeezy slides, Nike Dunk low, Essentials Hoodie and Pants, Burberry Bag My second CSSBuy Haul came in via JW-Tariffless today. The package arrived 21 days after i submitted it (24.05 submitted and 14.06 received). The service was great as always and i had absolutely no problems with the order or parcel. I dropped the shoe boxes to make the parcel not so heavy. I insured the full parcel and had some extra services such as the bubble film or the pasted invoice. I paid 490CNY (70‚Ç¨) for the shipping and 100‚Ç¨ for the products.  My Stats: 1,75cm , 70kg  The Products:  St√ºssy Tees: The Tees are size S and they fit great. Great stitching, no flaws, great 1:1 tees for summer. For 22‚Ç¨ there is no better pair of st√ºssy tees i think. Price: 22‚Ç¨ (10‚Ç¨ the black one and 12‚Ç¨ the white one). Overall rating 10/10  Polo Ralph Lauren pants: I chose size M and it fits perfect. The pants came with the tag on it. It has really nice stitching and feels great and comfortable. Would recommend. Price: 23‚Ç¨. Overall rating 9/10  Adidas Yeezy slides: The slides are very comfy but they are not true to size, I would say you have to go down 1 size. Quality looks good to me but when they came in, they were a little bit creased, probably because i shipped without a box. But i immediately got a little refund for the creases. Amazing service from CSSBuy. Price: 9‚Ç¨. Overall rating 8/10  Nike Dunk low: The dunks are for my sis and she literally wears them everyday at the moment. Nice stitching, amazing quality, i would say just like retail. They are true to size. Price: 29‚Ç¨. Overall Rating 10/10  Burberry Bah: to be honest this bag is really good and has plenty of space inside. The quality is good and it comes with all the tags and the packaging from burberry. Price: 25‚Ç¨. Overall rating 9.5/10  Essentials Tracksuit: the tracksuit is absolutely insane. It has perfect tags, stitching and quality overall. It fits perfect (size: M) and i would absolutely recommend it. Price: 25‚Ç¨(10‚Ç¨ for the hoodie and 15‚Ç¨ for the pants). Overall Rating 9.5/10  Overall Haul rating: 9.5/10  The W2C links are in the product images.

,comparison,"„ÄêRepsbrothers„ÄëFrom today, I will officially become a seller of TOP off-White.  From the day the RepsBrothers team was formed, we planned to be the Top seller of the 4-5 brands. CDG play is the first,  and the off-white is second, supreme is third...  Today I am very happy that I am officially a seller of the TOP off-white.  Because I don't have enough money to produce many products at the same time, I took the form of cooperation with the garment factory for the brand of Off-White. I proposed technical requirements and production specifications to the factory, and the factory guaranteed that the products would be supplied to me in priority.   Below I will show the comparison between our products and retail products. Please let me know if there is anything that needs to be improved, and I will make improvements in the next batch. **(  The picture on the top or left is retail,   The bottom picture or the right picture is the Repsbrothers's )**  &#x200B;  [ The Repsbrothers'  tape is slightly yellowish than retail ](https://preview.redd.it/85qk7gwtnzz51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22115279287a2f51d8040f363e0b140c6be28e1d)  [The Repsbrothers'  tape is slightly yellowish than retai](https://preview.redd.it/l0nlnvwtnzz51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6d958ac9d6ff8e61bf3080c69c751d7fbf1ac8d)  &#x200B;  [the main label is almost same with retail](https://preview.redd.it/suaalc0npzz51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1eaa6ee8f6a739a5b45606f5cb711a73af844b54)  [the wash label is almost same with retail,  Material imported from Italy.](https://preview.redd.it/49ywffwtnzz51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d4e4b572739f0385f7c457b3b3c3bcda062c5ec)  &#x200B;  [the wash label is almost same with retail,  Material imported from Italy.](https://preview.redd.it/fwmbngwtnzz51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b7520d74757c87348800dae87f98661d31a3cc9)  &#x200B;  [ One of the most successful OFF-WHITE](https://preview.redd.it/cnjyd5xtnzz51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e464829a27558c941f3b87f35ffa3791372676d)  [One of the most successful OFF-WHITE](https://preview.redd.it/8elnogwtnzz51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca284dc2809976c1e30be84eae8185d7b69bd413)  &#x200B;  [ The small letters are slightly different ](https://preview.redd.it/uu1r2xxtnzz51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd2fc7c7db399d7dd24fdb448ca7b6ee130ad609)  https://preview.redd.it/rt9wuxxtnzz51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=09af67dd8a3148bfae437c48e8132e7521b43a31  [ Gradual printing is always difficult, and I hope I can improve on it next batch](https://preview.redd.it/f6vcnfwtnzz51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee4d1a7da39021b6e73d6bdb6b77623f1693aae4)  [The small letters are slightly different ](https://preview.redd.it/x0ndjfwtnzz51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9c48bfc4b2cedc5b8187c245e0c654a36414b49)  [ This print is very simple , perfect.](https://preview.redd.it/1gnv4gwtnzz51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1db1888e5bea102becda72698260fedd50bf2499)  [This print is very simple , perfect.](https://preview.redd.it/e58cuswtnzz51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dead2593709e2c2eae52acc5b54ae78e0d415768)  [ Maybe Repsbrothers's is better than retail ?](https://preview.redd.it/n9rlcgwtnzz51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=216da97b834746b124a0cd80589050cd01309575)  [ This print has been printed many times ](https://preview.redd.it/anoolxxtnzz51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92423810efbb7f6337e606cf425f2fff5c7176fd)  https://preview.redd.it/xtyti5xtnzz51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddbbab2c14fcdbd73cad32f0f41d0498023e53e8  [Maybe Repsbrothers's is better than retail ?](https://preview.redd.it/r8ahdfwtnzz51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2440f553bf76a28285be5393516334ca9b29e4a6)  [ shorts.

"Versace,YSL","quality,price","A short review of ""Chez Pierre"" replicated scents by someone who rarely buys more than 1 fragrance So, this is a somewhat unusual review, as I am not exactly a regular perfume buyer. It's never appealed to me bar a few, due to the insane pricing of many of the supposedly ""designer"" scents. So I turned to looking at good-quality replicated scents, and so I stumbled upon a number of people recommending Chez Pierre, a Serbian guy who ships internationally.  Firstly, let me say the customer service here is exceptional. Even if the perfumes *weren't* top-rate (and they are, spoiler alert!), the communication and helpfulness as a seller is absolutely phenomenal for a venue like this. Chez (/u/peracar00) is genuinely a really nice guy, and nice to chat with about completely unrelated things on WhatsApp!  I ordered two scents, ""Bakar"" (c: MFK Baccarat Rouge 540) in 1:3 strength, 40ml Plastic and ""Magnificent Black"" (c: YSL Black Opium) in 1:4 strength, 40ml Plastic.   I don't recall ever actually smelling the ""real"" Baccarat Rouge, but I am familiar with some very similar / clone scents such as Cloud by Ariana Grande. It gets the scent very similar in my opinion, and it's a bit more masculine/unisex than Cloud (which other people also seem to agree on with the real BR). Being 1:3, I find the smell from Bakar pretty strong, not quite as overpowering as I expected it to be, but rather comparable to an EDP or slightly above if I were to buy it in a shop. It's great and probably going to be the main fragrance I use from now.  To my nose at least, Magnificent Black smells note-for-note identical to Black Opium off the mall shelf. I would without a doubt at least personally assume if I smelled it on someone it's the real thing. There quite literally to my nose isn't anything I can really smell different. It's really good and I really like the Chez copy.  So to summarise the rather short two paragraphs; I'm super pleased with both. One smells exactly like stock, and one smells fantastic even though I've never smelled the exact original.  I paid, including shipping to the UK, ¬£25 for the entire order. The order came super quick (around 4 days?) to my house from purchase, and I think the price I paid is a fantastic deal. Note that if you can't pay natively in EUR and need to pay in eg. USD or GBP, use Revolut. It'll save you a few bucks off the shitty PayPal conversion rates!   Did I mention I also got a nice lil' small gift (10ml? Hard to eyeball) glass vial of ""Daylight"" (c: Versace Dylan Blue)? Highly appreciated, again never smelled the original but I actually really damn like the smell of this one!  If you can't tell by this review already, this is a glowing recommendation from Chez, even if I haven't tried a number of these scents in stock. The customer service and actual quality of the perfumes - copy or not - has made me an instant repeat customer. As I said earlier, I am not a super-frequent user of fragrances, so I imagine this will take a while to finish my bottles, but I will me more than happy to make another order at some point in the future.  10/10 on every front. Recommended, especially for the scents I tried! üå∫‚ô•  (Copied from r/Fragrance);;He also has like the absolute best customer service shoutout to him","{upvote:13,timestamp:2021-04-28}",Reddit,1,1

I love haiders work and his jackets, they just give off such an air of luxury. This jacket is gorgeous with it being a VERY dark green, almost black at first glance. Highly recommend, the way the colors move on this jacket is wild. It looks incredible on person, with the drapey shoulders and the oversized lazy luxury look. Im docking points due to the shoulders on mine standing up more than the retail photos, as in they are rather pointy when it should be droopy. Not a big deal as you can just press them down in person, but I will point out the flaw anyways.  **A.A.

I saw the jacket on some instagram post and fell in love with it, its so beautiful, nice oversized construction, very warm and goose down filled. The stitching is immaculate on this jacket and it looks fantastic as a layering piece. The color is super nice and it has a slight metallic sheen to it. If anyone is on the fence, I highly recommend this piece, its one of my current favorites. It goes so well with a lot of things and overall an excellent statement piece.  **Gremade Homme Grey Suede jacket // 2300 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=602691368075) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/CNipVI3)  Size: L // Color: Grey  Looks: 10/10 // Feel: 10/10 // Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Beautiful suede trucker jacket in grey from my seller MadeByGu, this guy consistently makes high quality basics and I love his work. This jacket comes with his own tags but is absolutely stunning, I believe its made out of a goats leather, it is so smooth and soft to the touch. I absolutely love leather and suede jackets and this one is an amazing color. Rather pricey, but so is leather I guess. Highly recommend if you're looking for high quality basics.  **Hyein Seo Bomber Jacket // 629 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=630534304930&spm=1101.1101.N.N.c805155) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/GrPTdGT)  Size: 2 // Color: Brownish  Looks 9/10 // Feel: 10/10 Overall:9/10  Thoughts: This jacket I kinda bought on a whim when I saw it posted and its a very well made jacket. The jacket comes with a hood that I think is ugly and takes away from the jacket but is removable, leaving a very nice bomber underneath. The bomber is high quality and thick, and seems very warm. The color is beautiful, with the main brownish color being a slight metallic, and has a nice sheen when you look at it. Overall very good for the price, highly recommend.  I will however be selling this jacket as its not really my style and I just kind of impulse purchased it.  **Bottega Vanetta Wool Jacket // 998 yuan //**  [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4439077735&spider_token=4572&spm=1101.1101.N.N.27dfa93) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/4wc2E9s)  Size: M // Color: Black  Looks: 10/10 Feels:8/10 Overall: 8/10  Thoughts: This is the BV jacket from Kappler, so you know its high quality. Overall the jacket is very well made, with high quality thick wool. I am docking marks as the jacket is a little scratchy, and not that comfortable to wear for the price. Overall its well made, it is very cropped and goes very well as a plain basic jacket, with a very subtle flex for those that recognize it. The jacket itself is rather cropped but overall nice. Good looks, not that comfy to wear.  **Rough Simmons Bomber Jacket // 649 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=659706725969&spm=1101.1101.N.N.4879c7d) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/izBRxY3)  Size: M // Color: Green  Looks:9/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Ironically, this is a replica of a replica jacket lol. This jacket was made as a meme for the rough simmons brand, to create a replica of his RIOT bomber, and this is a replica of that jacket hahahahaha. Overall the construction on the bomber is really well made, its ridiculously thick and warm and well made and overall I highly recommend it. Very comfy and the inside is soft to the touch. Outside seems to be made of a denim-ish material.  **Haider Ackermann Silk Floral Bomber // 699 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=629433568294&spm=1101.1101.N.N.92b6f69) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/bj8NbRg)  Size: M // Color: Red  Looks: 9/10 Feels: 8/10 Overall:8.5/10  Thoughts: This jacket is high quality, very silky and looks like retail I believe, with a similar cut. So very drapey very loose. The jacket itself seems rather thin however, but its possible retail is like that, I am not sure. I am docking marks overall for being a thin jacket, but other than that, its a good jacket. Soft and silky to the touch, its a pretty nice statement piece that I would recommend.  **Deeds Leather Bomber jacket // 3788 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=659504376629&spm=1101.1101.N.N.cf85edb) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/QqVSzRr)  Size: M // Color: Black  Looks: 10/10 Feels: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Ok I will not lie, this piece was crazy expensive, but its insanely high quality and very well made. This seller consistently makes good quality stuff and this jacket is no different. Its a blend of goat and sheep leather I believe and has a very nice texture to it. From afar it looks rather like a nylon bomber, like a typical bomber, but up close you can see that it is actually a very nice leather. Overall ridiculously nice quality, also a ridiculous price point. If you have the money, I do recommend the jacket, its VERY nice.  **ALYX Puffer jacket // 940 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=660074953160&spm=1101.1101.N.N.6cc6e84) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/QIkPIxP)  Size: M // Color: Black  Looks: 10/10 Feels: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Again this jacket was bought on an impulse and I realize that I have wayyy too many jackets that I have no way of wearing. This jacket is very thick and warm overall and very well made. The alyx buckle on the neck seems well made and wont come loose or anything. I havent worn it outside but seems very warm and high quality. I will be selling this piece so take a look at my BST if you want to buy it. Overall I do recommend this jacket as it is very thick and warm.  **MKSZY Green Raccoon Bomber // 899 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=609889706454&spm=1101.1101.N.N.e54f0a1) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/GxQELJf)  Size: S // Color: Green  Looks:10/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: This jacket comes in a beautiful army green color that is pre-distressed and looks incredible in my opinion. It gives it a nice rain stained or like weathered look that I think pairs beautifully with the color. The bomber itself is lined with raccoon fur or at least that's what the post says. I believe the jacket is on a major discount as the seller is trying to get rid of old stock. The inside fur feels very high quality and soft to the touch and seems like a very warm jacket over. For the pricepoint, I think its an absolute steal. 10/10 recommend.  **Haider Ackermann Silk Bomber // 749 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-14467898476.35.4a101d2aGqNRu4&id=629580703961) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/Xr30vWm)  Size: M // Color: Black  Looks: 10/10 Feels: 9/10 Overall: 9/10  Thoughts: This jacket is significantly thicker than the red one that was posted earlier which is why I am rating it higher. Overall it is very high quality silk, or something very close to silk. It feels incredible to touch, it drapes well, this is an excellent jacket and I highly recommend it. I took some marks off of feel as the shoulders feel rather tight for the jacket, but I suppose that could just be me getting unlucky with QCs.  **Kapital Fleece Jacket // 388 yuan //**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=638414231090&spm=1101.1101.N.N.aaa1d50) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/UGHJNRO)  Size: M // Color: Khaki  Looks 9/10 Feels:8/10 Overall: 8/10  Thoughts: Its a fleece jacket, relatively simple and warm to wear. I am docking points as the fleece doesn't seem to be the highest quality overall, but that is to be expected from a cheaper rep I suppose. Nice jacket, pretty warm, has some padding so you can wear it in colder temps. Nice if you want a fleece jacket, but dont get your hopes up on some insane quality.  üëï **Tees/Long Sleeves/Sweaters/Crewnecks/Hoodies** üëï  **Undercover X Sacai Crewneck // 249 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-15816346795.53.6f372930BZT6iH&id=560604842969) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/bTxyok7)  Size: 5 // Color: Black  Looks:10/10 Feels:9/10 Overall 9/10  Thoughts: Nice and basic crewneck, I docked points as the sweater is fleece on the inside and I heavily prefer french terry inside. Although that is my subjective opinion so dont look too far into it. This store has a lot of nice undercover stuff if you were looking for some tees or hoodies or whatnot. Overall a nice basic crewneck, nothing much to say here. Good for the price  **Raf Denim Shirt // 259 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=631335926387&spm=1101.1101.N.N.f1f855c) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/GM7nCat)  Size: S // Color: Black  Looks 10/10 Feels:8/10 Overall: 9/10  Thoughts: I have absolutely 0 idea of the accuracy of this shirt. I bought it simply for the logo on the  shirt. Nothing too crazy to speak of, the shirt is average quality. Nothing special for the price. If youre looking for a raf shirt go for it but I am unsure of the accuracy on it.  **Saint Laurent Sail Shirt // 398 yuan**  [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4422997976&spider_token=4572&spm=1101.1101.N.N.d738edc) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/1qYIj65)  Size: S // Color: Black  Looks:10/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Another piece by Kappler, this shirt is also crazy nice. Its made of this soft and smooth viscose which feels super luxury and high quality. The shirt is relatively cropped however so do note that, but otherwise this shirt is crazy nice. Super nice summer piece, also great as a layering piece. Kappler doesnt miss. highly recommend.  üëñ Pants üëñ  **Rick Owens Bauhaus Cargos**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=612572113595&spm=1101.1101.N.N.21b1f77) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/Uu8Uiqq)  Size:48 // Color: Black  Looks:9/10 Feels:9/10 Overall: 9/10  Thoughts: Overall people comment that Pink Elephants drawstrings are too beige and nothing like retail, but when I compare the drawstrings to my retail pair, they seem very similar. I dont think it would ever be possible to call out in person. Overall nice pants, I havent touched retail so I cant comment on accuracy but these are not crazy comfy. The cotton is rather thick and scratchy but im unsure if retail is like that too. Either way probably the best reps were gonna get so I recommend.  üíé Accessories/Other üíé  **David Studio Chrome Hearts earrings // 180 yuan - 240 yuan**  [W2C](https://m.intl.taobao.com/detail/detail.html?id=638715576548&spm=1101.1101.N.N.63e008a) \+ [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=643376318749&spm=1101.1101.N.N.a046c87) \+ [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=575146719724&spm=1101.1101.N.N.615967b) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/S5bfOPt)  Looks:10/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: David Studios Chrome hearts, reviewed to death. High quality silver, none of his pieces have turned any of my skin green. Overall high quality big recommend.  **Raf Tote Bag // 238 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=638932550566&spm=1101.1101.N.N.c557d16) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/pfDBNee)  Looks:10/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: unsure of accuracy, I just wanted a tote bag to carry around. Comes with a very nice vintage feel to it already, overall nice back. Not long enough for cross body but goes over the shoulder well.  **Issey Miyake Pleated Bag // 138 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-19751379310.10.35e45b3bL7DyuW&id=607051369806) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/SBu9AE6)  Looks:10/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Same deal as the raf bag, Im unsure of accuracy, I just wanted a nice bag. This bag seems relatively high quality, with the pleats being pretty pronounced and solid. Very good bag for the price, imo this is a pickup if you want a nice bag.  üëü Shoes üëü  **Jiaofu's DIOR navigate boots // 1480 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-23295003257.19.44e545b4R3yYr5&id=660797450437) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/kNj2nnG)  Looks:10/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: So I preordered these a longggg time ago and with the preorder price, I ended up only paying 1100 yuan. Overall these are a phenomenal pair of combat boots, I believe he got the silhouette right on these and they look incredible on foot. Very nice winter wear and I am sure glad that I purchased them. Highly recommend if youre looking for a nice pair of combat boots. He also produces the shoe in patent leather and in pebble leather but Im not sure how many sizes he has left.  **Balenciaga X-pander // 780 yuan**  Dead link but these are all over weidian, just pick the cheapest link or look at Jin or Bean // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/7DMiOZ8)  Looks: 9/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Ok so Im pretty sure theres only one batch of these right now anyways, so just pick the cheapest link that you can find. The shoe overall is very well made, with each shoe having a surprising weight to them. Theyre actually really comfy to walk in ive found and I did not need to break them in at all. They do feel weird sometimes though, kinda like walking in short high heels. Nothing that you cant get used to however. Very nice pair of shoes, highly recommend if youre looking for something diffferent. These look best with loose pants i will say.  **Guidi PL2 // 988 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=578789639171&spm=1101.1101.N.N.fbc8059) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/4i5mHW1)  Size: 43 // Color: Black  Looks:10/10 Feels:10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: The folks over at Qreps say that this is horse leather and when comparing to my retail pair of 986s, it seems like it could be horse leather. Overall the shoes are well constructed, I really liked the aesthetics on them so I got a pair. Compared to retail however, the shaft is looser for sure. Not an issue on foot but just something to keep an eye out for. Additionally, the leather comes with a weird sheen on it but once you rub some leather polish on it, it looks just like retail. Overall, execellent boots for the price in my opinion and I recommend them.  **Amiri Desert Combat Boots // 398 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=626495137087&spm=1101.1101.N.N.9ce14ba) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/sNOkVlZ)  Size: 43 // Color: Desert 1  Looks:10/10 Feels: 9/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: I honestly had really low expectations going into this, like cmon what kind of boot for 80 cad is going to be good? But actually these boots were pleasantly surprising. They are pretty high quality, with no glue stains or poor stitching anywhere and they seem to hold up well to the outdoors. I havent taken them out into like crazy snow due to the seude on them but they seem to hold up well as combat boots! Absolutely unbeatable for the price and I highly recommend. I docked a point for comfort as they are a bitch to lace up and they arent CRAZY comfy, but for 80$? who can complain.  **Bottega Vanetta Lug Sole Boots // 250 cad shipped**  [W2C](https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/796073661/mens-womens-leather-italian-calfskin?click_key=c3f8f12c63ab54da710295592315cf229a57289c%3A796073661&click_sum=f393e23f&ref=shop_home_active_59&frs=1&crt=1) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/Z22IefE)  Size: 42 // Color: Normal Black  Looks:10/10 Feels: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Apologies for the poor photos. I realize that I didnt have any real photos of the product alone so I had to use my comparison pics to my retail pair from a while ago. For reference the reps are the pair on the right, with the shinier leather. The boots themselves are fantastic quality, being very similar to retail ive noticed with the only exceptions being the shinier leather and a slightly looser shaft. Not an issue on foot as it is unnoticable. Overall incredible reps for only 1/8 the retail cost. Highly recommend this seller. Took him a while to ship out, but once he actually shipped it out, it was like UPS priority, only took like 1.5 days to get to my doorstep.  &#x200B;  **TECHWEAR**  **ACG 2 in 1 jacket // 1550 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=577099236975&spm=1101.1101.N.N.ade196) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/Oimrs8w)  Size: S // Color: Black  Looks:10/10 Feels: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Honestly if I could rebuy the jacket in a size larger I would, but unfortunately it is what is it. The size chart isnt crazy accurate with the chest being like 4cm off in the chest making it kinda tight. Otherwise tho, the jacket is super high quality, very warm and seem good. Recommend, but perhaps size up once based on their size charts.  **Acronym J1TS-S HD // 1320 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=564039991384&spm=1101.1101.N.N.ef43524) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/MoONYWD)  Size: M // Color: Black  Looks:10/10 Feels: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Same deal as the jacket above, super high quality jacket, perhaps a little on the thin side, but that just leaves more room for a layering techwear coat underneath. Highly recommend, this one fits the size chart correctly. I hear its not quite retail level, but Im satisfied looking at the jacket and the quality.  **Acronym J1B-GT // 968 yuan**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-18654917936.27.24645230iyXXtV&id=652257168131) // [Photos/QC](https://imgur.com/a/CIqUujz)  Size: S // Color: Black  Looks:10/10 Feels: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  Thoughts: Honestly similar to the above jackets, it just doesnt come with the Acronym branding and comes with the stores own ninjawarning tag instead. Overall the quality feels similar to the expensive batches. If you dont care about tags, buy from ninjawarning instead. Overall recommend the jacket.;;I might be dumb but I can‚Äôt find the w2c for the Acg jacket and the first black jacket shown in the imgur link.","{upvote:10,timestamp:2022-02-03}",Reddit,0,

LV,quality,"Cuban Link stainless steel Necklace and Bracelet set and LV Spaceman Keychain from HLin Jewelry ### W2C  * WhatsApp:  +86 156 2702 2716  * Website:  http:// hlinjewelry. x. yupoo. com  * Instagram:  hlinjew_official   * WeChat:  SAMHO-ZXH  * Mention REPREVIEW for $5 off  ### REVIEW   The necklace and bracelet are both heavy duty and sturdy and the links are clean and conformed. I pulled on the necklace with a little bit of torque to test its strength integrity and it stated intact. The clasps work well and don't get stuck and lock in place easily and unclasp easily. Not really much else to review for them, they feel like a good quality Cuban link chain set. I did do a lead test on them and they came up negative for lead. I included a photo at the end.   The LV Astronaut Spaceman keychain from what I can tell based on comparing them to photos looks good. The LV engravings are clean and centered and placed well. The LV text on the key ring looks spaced well and placed evenly. The LV engravings on the clip looks clean and has good size and placed well. A few nitpicky things I noticed that weren't the same is the LV on the chest has wider top lines and the circle in the bottom right is smaller on the real one. Also the engravings on the back is not as clean and text is a little off. Also tested this for lead and it came back negative. Overall a solid LV keychain rep.   ### Experience with Seller  This is my second time dealing with HLin and communication and responsiveness was good. They answered all my questions and QC and shipping was very fast. I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for quality jewelry reps with great customer service.   Let me know what you think and if I missed anything.","{upvote:58,upvoteRatio:0.94,timestamp:2024-01-19}",Reddit,1,1

I was nervous after seeing the QC because the color looked too yellow, but it must be PB lighting. After watching LC videos and comparisons, the only things I can find that are off are small details such as the feeling of the sticker in the box and the number of stitches on the back of the shoe.

The color is pretty yellow in person. Unlike retail, the bottom of this shirt was hemmed. In my in-hand pictures, you can see what it looks like after I cut just above the hem. The fit is a little off compared to retail. Retail has more of a boxy fit compared to this shirt. Disappointed in the sizing printing, as it was sewn into the collar. Puff print is amazing afaik.

No complaints about this jacket whatsoever. It is super high quality, especially the KSG picture on the back. The stitching of the picture is very good, maybe even better than retail.

The length is slightly shorter than most tees, but it fits nice.  Looks: 9/10  Quality: 8/10  Comfort: 7/10  The text is much lighter than the authentic shirt. The most important part of this tee is the print, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. There are slight glue marks on the bottom of the shirt. Pandabuy made me aware of this, but I decided it was a minor issue. The size tag seems accurate, but there is no size listed on the shirt. The material of the shirt is super thick. It feels decently heavy, but it is rigid, making it slightly uncomfortable. Great simple shirt for a very cheap price.

Runs slightly smaller than most XLs. I would go TTS. Size up if between sizes.  Looks: 8/10  Quality: 7/10  Comfort: 6/10  The graphics on the shirt appear to be ""blurry"" for lack of better words. There is also an oil stain at the top of the shirt, on the cacti branding. Pandabuy once again made me aware of this. I realize this is a very cheap shirt, but I am disappointed that both of my shirts from FLANEUR ATELIER have stains. Once again it is wearable, but it is disappointing. Also, the size on the size tag is not included, just like the BLONDED shirt. I am unsure what the reasoning for this is. Maybe to not be able to resale? I feel I got exactly what I paid for with this shirt. Decent quality with pretty cool branding. Sadly this shirt is no longer on sale for those interested. It may be somewhere on FLANEUR's site.

Looks cheap. They are.  Quality: Pendant: 8/10 Chain: 5/10. Expected for a $5 necklace  I bought these necklaces knowing the quality would be low. The silver necklace is different from the listing pictures. There are colorful bits in the silver pendant, whereas the listing was meant to look more diamond-like. Pieces of the silver chain broke off after only one day of wear. I did not do anything excessive, it just slipped out one of the rings and fell off. I did get many compliments from these. They fit pretty tight, especially the silver now that it is shorter. Very close to choker length. These are pretty cool pieces, but alternatives could likely be found on Etsy or even your local mall.

Quality: 8/10  Fair warning to anyone copping, these have ZERO stretching ability. These were too tight, especially around thigh areas and even length. I attempted many methods to stretch these out, to no avail. And no, I will not show the fit. These feel great in hand though, so I may consider buying again in the future. On both pants, the small print on the pocket has some errors on it (see in hand). It reads ""EAS Y FITTING ANO LASTING VALUE"". The inside feels fairly warm. These would be great for the fall.

It arrived the day after I shipped out the haul. It looks pretty great from QC pics and I can't wait to have them in person.   # KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM MY FIRST HAUL  * Be aware of when carriers ship out. It only adds more waiting if you submit the parcel days before they actually ship out. * Pay attention to measurements on QC. I probably could've known the pants were too small if I would have looked at the length.  * Check spelling closely on all items. * Do not buy something just to fill space in your haul. Even wasting $5 is still wasting. The money could be used for something better or a later haul. * Pandabuy is the goat. * Popular sellers such as chaosmade and Fleneur can be very hit or miss. Products are cheap because they likely produce them cheaply and quickly. * Buying reps is fun! * The sub and discord reviews/ QCs are your best friend.  I had so much fun with my first haul. Although it was not a perfect process or outcome, I am still satisfied with how it went. I hope I could provide some insight for your future hauls.

I actually wanted to send it back to the seller but It was too late to do it so I just shipped it. Material its really stretchy, it has a stiching problem near the sleeve on the right, you might see it on the picture. Well, tell me whats wrong with it if you can. 7/10 3.

,"quality,opinions,thoughts,comparison","2024 TNF Comparison between Husky, WWTOP and 0832 Club So recently I‚Äôve been in the hunt for the best Rep TNF nuptse in the market that is known to us rep fam which is Husky, WWTOP and 0832 club. (there might be other be other seller that has better batches on Weidian but who knows)   I‚Äôve GPed some to my Pandabuy warehouse and decided to help those people who are in search for the best rep nuptse out there.  Would appreciate some upvotes as it really took some time and effort to put into details.  Disclaimer: these are all MY opinions on which is better so feel free to comment down below if you have any thoughts.  From the embroidery logo, IMO husky nailed it the best. WWTOP has a slightly taller ‚ÄúN‚Äù and no gap in between the stripes. 0832 428Y has gap in between the lines and the ‚ÄúF‚Äù is slightly off. 0832 378Y has gap in between N, O & R.  From 700 embroidery on sleeve, I think Husky takes the win here too for quality and thickness of embroidery, WWTOP is ok but looks slightly thin. The 0832 428Y 0 has too less of a gap and 0832 378Y feels thin and too squared off.  From the top ‚Äúblue tint‚Äù honestly speaking, I personally think all of them have them but some of them might be more pronounced than others, which I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big concern. Puffiness as well, I feel like some retail pics also seems less puffy. From QC pics, I‚Äôm sure with the whole tennis ball and dryer trick will get you 0.85-0.9:1 compared to retail. Do not expect reps to be 1:1, if not, retail wouldn‚Äôt exist no more. WEAR WITH CONFIDENCE  Feel free to comment and correct me for my mistakes.

Lululemon,"quality,thoughts","Review of more Lululemon items from Lulu Tom! Hey everyone! I ended up getting another order delivered from Lulu Tom (TS) and wanted to share. Some items are replicas of retail and others are fantasy or similar to retail. Overall the quality is really good, but some items are higher quality than others. The text on the Lululemon cardboard tags all appear to be similar except for the sizing, which is accurate.  **Disclaimer**  I bought two of these items (Align Shorts & mens joggers), but the rest were sent as free gifts to share about here. Also, Lulu Tom (TS) does not use agents and ships direct. Find his contact info in the Trusted Sellers list: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/wiki/trusted#wiki\_lululemon](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/wiki/trusted#wiki_lululemon)  **Images (mine)**  [https://imgur.com/a/5jNIM7C](https://imgur.com/a/5jNIM7C)  **Items**  Each of the items below are reviewed in order as they appear in the Imgur album above.  **Swiftly Tech Long Sleeve 2.0 (Blue) ‚Äì¬†Medium**  This shirt is really soft, stretchy, and breathable. My wife really likes how it fits and said she plans on using it when she goes for a jog. Inside the sleeve there is a little strap of material you can put your thumb through to keep the sleeves down while being active.  **Workout shirt with mesh back (Pink) ‚Äì Large**  This one didn‚Äôt end up fitting my wife as she had hoped, but she had some thoughts on it. It feels sort of like the kind of shirt you‚Äôd wear when surfing. It‚Äôs soft and comfortable but was too short. She said it would be good for a dance class or something where you want a bit more room to breathe in your midsection.  **Sports bra with built-in mesh shirt (Black) - Large**  This one is really well-made and very comfortable. It is a sports bra but has a sort of mesh mini shirt attached to it. The material is really soft and high quality. The stitching is great especially on the mesh, which is impressive.  **Mens joggers with zipper pockets (Black) - Large: $26**  These joggers are really soft and lightweight. They‚Äôre super comfortable and I could spend all day in them. They have zipper pockets on the front which I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of at first, but I don‚Äôt think it will bother me too much.  **Align High-Rise Shorts (Black Camo) ‚Äì Size 8: $20**  These shorts were ordered for my sister and they are made from a super soft, extremely stretchy material. The material feels just like the Align leggings I ordered last time, but with more stretch to them and a bit thinner. Still just as comfy though. The camo print looks awesome, in my opinion, and I think she will definitely like these.  **Mens workout shirt (Gray Camo/Paint)**  This shirt didn‚Äôt end up fitting me very well. While the materials is light, soft, and breathable it doesn‚Äôt feel very high quality and seems that it might break down faster than the other items. I really like how it looks, but it just didn‚Äôt end up fitting me well in the right places.  **Mens shorts similar to Pace Breaker Linerless Shorts (Black)**  These shorts are awesome. They‚Äôre really comfy and soft and have zipper pockets, which I like more on these shorts since they‚Äôre sort of hidden away by the flaps of fabric in front of them. They go down to just above the knee on me and I am 6‚Äô (182 cm) tall.  Overall, really happy with these items and I plan on finding some people who can use the items that didn‚Äôt end up fitting me. üòÅ;;English is not my Mother tongue, can you tell how the mens Joggers fit?

Tommy Hilfiger,quality,"[Review] Blackcat Canada Goose Chilliwack Bomber Jacket - Color Black - Size L As many of you want to know more about the quality and the looks of Blackcats CG Jackets especially of his Chilliwack, this will be an in detail review :)  To start with I want to talk about Blackcat as a seller:  **#1 Service:**  Blackcat is a really trustworthy seller who is really calm and cares about his customers as well as about this community. Ordering this Jacket was pretty easy, however I had to deal with bad badges. However it was not a problem at all to exchange the faulty jacket and get a new one. Even better is the fact that you can ask for IN ADVANCE QC PICTURES.  Yes, many of you know but there are still people who don't. So it's possible for you to tell him the order number via WeChat or via your agent and ask for QC pictures before shipping the product. That way you can assure that you won't get wonky badges and bad fur ;)  &#x200B;  Shipping the actual Jacket was very fast. It only took 1 day from shipping until reaching my warehouse.  &#x200B;  **#2 Overall Quality**  Blackcat's Chilliwack feels sturdy and well buildt. You won't find any loose threads or down leaking.  Everything looks and feels clean.  However I have the feeling that the outside material is a bit thinner than retail. I don't know if this has an effect on the warmth of the jacket or the waterproofness...  &#x200B;  **#3 Badge Quality**  I think we can all agree and there is no denial that Blackcat has, at least for now, the best Badge that gets the closest to retail. Let me tell you why:  1. The distance between leaves and letters is small like on retail. If there is much spacing like on BC Freestyle Vest or on StoneStores badge you can callout the badge pretty easily. 2. The thickness of the leaves is almost same as on retail. It's a tiny bit thicker but you can't notice it in person. It's MUCH better than Feiyu's thicc leaves ;) 3. Sun/Compass and the Island does not touch. I know this happens on retail too sometimes but I want to mention it anyways ;) 4. Quality of the letters is consistant, stitching is well done.  &#x200B;  **#4 Fur Quality**  The fur quality varies from jacket to jacket. That's because it is of course real fur from real animals who aren't equal of course ;)  My jacket has a decent fur. It could be better to be honest. It looks crinkly but still good. Colorwise it could be a bit more yellowish but as I said before, it's totally random what you'll get.  The fur has a slight smell to it which doesn't bother me at all. It just smells like any fur does :)  &#x200B;  **#5 Down Quality**  This is probably the most interesting point for many of you since there was a review about BC's Expedition Jacket where a person cut open the Down pockets to reveal the quality of the filling.  He said he is not sure what type of down is used or if it's real down at all or some kind of synthetic fibres.  &#x200B;  I can assure you that, at least for the Chilliwack, Blackcat uses real Down for the filling :)  Why? Because I took some down and put it under my macro lens ;)  Therefore please have a look at the Imgur Album!  &#x200B;  **#6 Warmness**  Since temperatures in Germany didn't drop below 0¬∞C yet I could only test it at about 3¬∞C...  Result: The jacket is warm. To be more specific: it's more warm than my $400 retail Tommy Hilfiger Down Jacket.  1. The pockets are lined so your hands stay warm 2. The down pockets are filled very well so the whole jacket keeps you warm 3. The fur is extremely helpful to protect your ears from cold wind  &#x200B;  **#7 Fitting**  Here comes the point where maybe many of you will be left unsatisfied...  ...The jacket is slightly too small for my comfort. Especially the arm lenght bothers me. You will see what I mean if you have a look at the Fit Pics.  Why I am bothered?  I am 187cm tall, my weight is 76kg.  Usually I wear size M or L in Jackets. For BC I went with size L and it's still too small.  That's why I ordered the Jacket one more time in size XL...so stay tuned ;)  &#x200B;  **#8 Conclusion**  For just 799Y you'll get an awesome Canada Goose Chilliwack Rep with all the necessary details, a basically 1:1 badge as well as real wolf/coyote fur and real down filling.  &#x200B;  What do you want more? :)  &#x200B;  [Detailed Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/gBacL6a)\*  [Fit Pics](https://imgur.com/a/nt8A5Z1)\*  [W2C Yupoo](https://blackcatstudio.x.yupoo.com/albums/73311285?uid=1)  [W2C TaoBao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a2oq0.12575281.0.0.25911debNDIFnq&ft=t&id=607426557009)  &#x200B;  \*Pictures have slight red tint. Fit pics were brightened a bit.;;RE: the down, I believe the other review said it was of a lower quality down -- not that it was not down. Your pictures seem to confirm that as well.    Jacket warmth comes from down fill power, which is a property of down CLUSTERS. Jackets are supposed to be filled with down CLUSTERS, but what is inside that jacket is a down FEATHER (which is what pillows have)  Google the difference between down clusters and feathers to learn more.  Nice review nonetheless","{upvote:7,timestamp:2019-11-15}",Reddit,1,0

I love the fact that you can basically see every step that your package has taken from when it has been 'Purchased' by your agent, to when it arrives at the Pandabuy warehouse, to when the parcel is being 'Stored'. Shipping from Pandabuy was quick compared what others have told me.  **Sidenote:** *I live in the UK (Manchester) and usually make hauls here, however I was visiting family and I thought that shipping to Saudi would take weeks longer, was surprised at how fast the process was, there was some confusion on where the package should have been sent but that was on behalf of the Saudi shipping company and if it weren't for that error the package would have taken a total of 17 days from ordering to arrival (faster than the times I get here in the UK)*  # Shipping  [Full details of shipping timeline here.](https://imgur.com/a/rUojDCG)  **Carrier:** GD-E-EMS // **Total weight:** 4.9kg  **Total time from 'seller' to 'warehouse':** 8 days   **Total time from 'warehouse' to 'me':** 13 days  ***Total shipping time:*** *21 days*   \---------------------------------------------------------------------   **Items Total:**¬†¬•1118.16 // ¬£133.37 // $168.95   **Shipping Total:** ¬•733.40 // ¬£87.48 // $110.82  ***Total Cost:*** *¬•1851.56 // ¬£220.85 // $279.77*  &#x200B;  |*Timeline*|*Dates*| |:-|:-| |Ordered Items|19/07/2023| |All Items Arrived at Warehouse|27/07/2023| |Parcel Arrived|09/08/2023| |Total Shipping Time|21 Days|  &#x200B;  |*Details*|| |:-|:-| |Actual Weight|4900g| |Estimated Weight|5312g| |Actual Weight (Items only)|4312g| |Weight of Parcel Box + Extras|588g| |Actual Shipping Cost|¬•733.40 // ¬£87.48 // $110.82| |Estimated Shipping Cost|¬•795.15 // ¬£94.85 // $120.15| |Extras \~ Stretch Film, Corner Protection|¬•20.00 // ¬£2.39 // $3.02| |Declare Amount|$66|  ***Note:*** *If the weight doesn't add up between all the items it's because I bought another item as well, but it's a private item that I didn't feel comfortable adding to the list.*  \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  # Shoes  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # Air Jordan 1 'Dark Mocha' - DG Batch (EU43)  # Seller: Passerby  https://preview.redd.it/ujw2s961xrlc1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc4e63f234698e071a4ca30e0e0d43d481b887af  **Weight (No Box):** 979g  **Price: ¬•250** (+¬•10 Domestic Shipping) // ¬£29.83 (+¬£1.20) // $37.76 (+$1.50)  **Shipping cost (To Saudi Arabia):** ¬•146.53 // ¬£17.48 // $22.14  **Total Price:** ¬•406.53 // ¬£48.51 // $61.40  [**W2C (Weidian)**](https://shop1814230492.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4428977916&spider_token=4572) **//** [**PandaBuy Link**](https://www.pandabuy.com/product?url=PJ5l5VO1l8KMW0N%2B%2BNUxRLtlHuiuLG2fk9yHJbeI%2B8Tc9lCRGPQArT7dYPUhOmFUl%2Fp%2B6arsfBzH4hMir%2Bztge4iW1k942lqBWvVrQ%3D%3D&utm_source=orderList&utm_medium=pdb&utm_campaign=normal) **//** [**QC**](https://imgur.com/a/DC81MbQ) **//** [**In Hand**](https://imgur.com/a/Vvemvt0)  **Accuracy: 7/10 // Comfort: 8/10 // Quality: 6.5/10 // Fit: TTS**  **Notes:** *3 days to warehouse. Shipped without box.*  Didn't get it with the box as I don't care for that sort of thing, it's not like I'm ever selling it. These were for a cousin and the sizing is most definetely the same as retail. Comfortability-wise they feel *just* like the retail. There were 2 problems with these that I found. First of all, and this one wasn't quite as annoying, is that the Suede was pretty flat when these arrived. However, I knew this was a common problem before purchasing these so I bought a suede brush ahead of time. After brushing it the suede looked exactly the same as retail, no problems there. The second thing however is that the top leather on the toe-box peeled off at not even the slightest of creases. I wear crease protectors and this happened after literally the first wear, on both pairs. [Picture here](https://imgur.com/a/kgnCjFh). As for the problem I've seen other users post, that the tongue and the toe-box are different colours, that wasn't the case for me the tongue was the perfect colour, same as retail.  &#x200B;  # Air Max TN Plus 3 'Black/White' (EU41)  # Seller: umkao  https://preview.redd.it/5bxwlqw1xrlc1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=0488c471723da6f07e430838c8a6a26f201034c0  **Weight (No Box):** 820g  **Price: ¬•180** (+¬•10 Domestic Shipping) // ¬£21.47 (+¬£1.20) // $27.20 (+$1.50)  **Shipping cost (To Saudi Arabia):** ¬•122.73 // ¬£14.64 // $18.55  **Total Price:** ¬•312.73 // ¬£37.31 // $47.25  [**Yupoo**](https://umkao.x.yupoo.com/albums/101770668?uid=1&isSubCate=true&referrercate=15857&utm_source=copyLink) **//** [**W2C (TaoBao)**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=671312579558) **//** [**PandaBuy Link**](https://www.pandabuy.com/product?url=PJ0oMZUDxf8a6N6%2FwrUUXClhLotsVar4mcd9kphA%2BskCb55%2FsytOYOL1r%2Bno%2FnPqgNWEQqAbMWyqH12X&utm_source=orderList&utm_medium=pdb&utm_campaign=normal) **//** [**QC**](https://imgur.com/a/WDCdfdS) **//** [**In Hand**](https://imgur.com/uSEB5bk)  **Accuracy: 6/10 // Comfort: 8/10 // Quality: 8/10 // Fit: TTS**  **Notes:** *8 days to warehouse.

They look the same as retail but the only problem is that they have a purple hue to them and are a bit lighter on the sides compared to retail.  &#x200B;  # Yeezy Slides 'Black' (US8)  # Seller: Budgetshoes  https://preview.redd.it/s8vf1rj2xrlc1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc960752765bac243404d45d6aac213f6770a5cc  **Weight (No Box):** 377g  **Price: ¬•59** (+¬•10 Domestic Shipping) // ¬£7.04 (+¬£1.20) // $8.92 (+$1.50)  **Shipping cost (To Saudi Arabia):** ¬•56.43 // ¬£6.73 // $8.53  **Total Price:** ¬•125.43 // ¬£14.97 // $18.95  [**W2C (Weidian)**](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7133488619&spider_token=4572) **//** [**PandaBuy Link**](https://www.pandabuy.com/product?ra=478&url=PJ6odvDMyfhdqBkwSmURJGow1KQs6I8%252FYd%252BeK4tLDJKSNzU92pX3JAdLwvPyfheGxDys%252FA%253D%253D&utm_source=url&utm_medium=pdb&utm_campaign=normal) **//** [**QC**](https://imgur.com/a/4ZsRESp) **//** [**In Hand**](https://imgur.com/Vaa4uD4)  **Accuracy: 9/10 // Comfort: 9.5/10 // Quality: 9/10 // Fit: TTS**  **Notes:** *4 days to warehouse.

These came wrinkled as they were packaged tightly, my advise is to just use a hot hair drier for a couple minutes the wrinkles go away instantly ([**Before/After**](https://imgur.com/a/lty3Hrp)). I'm EU size 41, I wanted to size up so I got EU size 42 which should be UK size 8 but I recieved UK size 7 (US size 8). However there was no need to size up as these fit great.  &#x200B;  # Apparel  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # Nike Tech Fleece 'Cream' (Size XS)  # Seller: Husky Reps  https://preview.redd.it/52zqzxa3xrlc1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6afe108bcbd38876862c7c5fc4adad71d24326e  **Weight:** 572g  **Price: ¬•245** (+¬•10 Domestic Shipping) // ¬£29.22 (+¬£1.20) // $37.02 (+$1.50)  **Shipping cost (To Saudi Arabia):** ¬•85.61 // ¬£10.21 // $12.94  **Total Price:** ¬•340.61 // ¬£40.63 // $51.46  [**Yupoo**](https://alaska-reps.x.yupoo.com/albums/120056462?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=3982266) **//** [**W2C (TaoBao)**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=764105970364) **//** [**PandaBuy Link**](https://www.pandabuy.com/product?ra=670&url=PJ9jmDFVd3v76X1cw7LAybayVJoo9xYox12WJ7XWvKbTjiurIpEPvH3kW38eJq1tE7pbCB5aYRPM3OwP&utm_source=url&utm_medium=pdb&utm_campaign=normal) **//** [**QC**](https://imgur.com/a/jZeUKcW)  **Accuracy: 9/10 // Comfort: 9/10 // Quality: 9/10 // Fit: TTS**  **Notes:** *2 days to warehouse*  My brother buys and sells real Nike Techs and he bought this for himself to see the compared quality. It's exactly the same. No differences from what I can tell. If I find any flaws I'll update you guys. I'm usually a Size Small in most tops but with the retail Nike Techs they're a bit bigger and I fit best into an XS. This was the same size as retail so if you are unsure of sizing I'd suggest you go to your nearest Nike store and try the sizes out there.  &#x200B;  # Stussy Beanie 'Black' (One Size)  # Seller: Husky Reps  https://preview.redd.it/953xkz24xrlc1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=6414f3029c5d8a2d70b420416a7aef9fbb1867d5  **Weight:** 94g  **Price: ¬•37** // ¬£4.41 // $5.59  **Shipping cost (To Saudi Arabia):** ¬•14.07 // ¬£1.68 // $2.13  **Total Price:** ¬•51.07 // ¬£6.09 // $7.72  [**W2C (TaoBao)**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=632049016020) **//** [**PandaBuy Link**](https://www.pandabuy.com/product?url=PJ0eFpUDxf8a6N6%2FwrUUXClhLotsVar4mcd9kphA%2BskCb55%2FU6YZUJlbhjxaBcsB49uPWteUxwa%2Bp%2BL%2B&utm_source=orderList&utm_medium=pdb&utm_campaign=normal) **//** [**QC**](https://imgur.com/a/4wmABYE) **//** [**In Hand**](https://imgur.com/a/mApULwk)  **Accuracy: 9.5/10 // Comfort: 9/10 // Quality: 9/10 // Fit: TTS**  **Notes:** *2 days to warehouse*  Perfect, no difference to retail.

"LV,Uniqlo,Patagonia","quality,price,haul","3.8kg Haul w/ 15 Tees, 2 Ray-Bans, 1 LV Belt (CDG, Balmain, Stone Island, Balenciaga, Ralph) This is like my 3rd haul. My t-shirt game was looking weak with so many blanks (shoutout Uniqlo tho, their shirts soft af), so I decided to add some branding and flex on deez broke hoes. Copped some for my homie (same size) too, which explains the two CDG heart tees.  **Customs/Shipping:** I get shook every time, but I'm in the US so they're chill. Told superbuy to declare $72USD (Under $130 for China customs) I ***always*** shrink wrap my parcel so customs isn't motivated to touch it, and it's worked so far. tbh I hard a hard time opening this so I'd imagine they wouldn't be bothered to try. In the end, this shit flew through customs in 5 minutes and got here the next day.  Shipped 7/26, Arrived 7/29 through EMS (aka Chinese Amazon Prime Deluxe)  **Stats**  Height: 5' 10""/177cm  Weight: 145lbs/65.7kg  Sex: yea, u know me  Build: Skinnyish muscular athletic type beat, shoulders kinda wide  Size: Mostly M, but I measure my chest, length and shoulders from a my best fitting shirt. USE SIZE CHARTS  **Last Comment:** These were taken right out the parcel, and haven't been worn but sizing looks accurate.

I went into store and tried on the auth and it was perfect. * From memory the color of the gold looks the same as the one I tried in store. It comes with a custom gold certificate from China as well!  * The  clasp feels secure. I don't think I will have an issue with it. I ask for PSP video of opening and closing the clasp just in case   **Accuracy -** 10/10  * Font - the font looks the same as the ones i have come across in my research, carat weight is diff for different size bracelet. The sizing of the font looks 100% accurate. The depth of the font looks perfect; not too faint or too deep. * Width - the width of the bracelet appears to be the same as in store * Color - the color looks perfect, it doesn't look too light, yellow, or pink which is in line for 18k yellow  * Diamonds - accurate in my opinion. She told me the diamonds would be DEF VS and they look similar to my F color e-ring * Shape - the bracelet has the correct oval shape like the auth * Size 15 feels accurate. When I tried it in store, I tried on the small and it fit the same as the Size 15. My wrist size is 14.5 cm for reference and wear a size 16 (loose fit) for Cartier love bracelet.   **Seller Communication and Service** \- 10/10  * she's always quick to respond and doesn't get upset when i ask for additional photos or videos.

"LV,Prada",popular,Serious question where do you guys see the future of Fashion Reps Not the sub reddit but the actual reps themselves say 5 years from now  Do you see them getting harder to buy?  Do you think they will be cheaper more expensive?  Do you think they'll have a crackdown and ban reps coming from foreign countries?  Do you think reps will only be the most popular items bape hoodies and Jordan ones or do you see them expanding more into fashion brands such as rick prada 424 etc..   &#x200B;  Im kind of new to all this so id love to hear your guys opinion's;;I think the prices may go up for some stuff for a short time. Due to the increased popularity of busystone (especially since he's branching out to other popular brands here) he us delivering on our desire for quality. I think he may be setting a standard for rep quality as we move forward. With that I also think that other sellers will come along and want a peice of the pie and become direct competitors to busystone. I beleive this competition will then result in competitive pricing driving some prices down and increased promotions.  Overall I think the quality will continue to increase on popular brands and more high-end boutique type sellers will come along.,"{upvote:2,timestamp:2020-10-14}",Reddit,1,1

However, there is glitter on this jacket that comes off. It is a bit annoying but bearable. Reason for the -1 on the review.  The buttons and patchwork on the back is great. The cactus plant on the back seems a bit taller than retail however im not fussed. The splatter paint on the jacket varies on each retail jacket so can get away with that.  &#x200B;  **Essentials FOG Track Pants 8/10**  Weight 670g  Size M   [QC](https://imgur.com/a/LlavxnP)  [In hand pic](https://imgur.com/a/hBWBhI1)  The sizing is way off for this one.

I'm gonna wear this at home only.  **The seller for all of the above is CLOY AD.**  Wechat: Cloyad999   Yupoo. Cloydstudio. x. yupoo . com  Seller rating 10/10.

In terms of quality, I love this hoodie. As retail, the blank is thicker than a Snickers, and could really hold up during some harsh winter conditions. The embroidery passes as far as i'm concerned, and honestly couldn‚Äôt give a fuck if someone tries to call me out - whole idea is just childish, rock your clothes with confidence. Enough soapboxing, seriously Teenage club did an excellent job with this hoodie, washtags and neck tags seem to be on point, side tag is a little wonky, but this thing dropped in 2008 so there‚Äôs some room for imperfections.  # Stone Island Overshirt x3  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/NNERX5v) |[ Fitpics](https://imgur.com/a/MzOgAsk)  [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=599081333543)  Rating: 8/10  Price: $44.44  I do enjoy these jackets but there is one thing that really bothered me - the pink. Comparing to retail, the color on the jacket Stoney produced is pretty off, it's much more darker and muted than what is shown for the retail listing, almost a light plum color. Nevertheless, the quality is still bar none, and will be slaying with these pieces left and right regardless of color.  # Canada Goose Vest  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/8hsgz55) |[ Fitpics](https://imgur.com/a/e7b5n4L)  [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=604230734955&spm=1101.1101.N.N.d389e9f)  Rating: 11/10  Price: $44.94  I have had my eye on a Canada Goose vest since I had bought Feiyu‚Äôs Langford jacket, but given Feiyu‚Äôs prices, I couldn‚Äôt rationalize spending that type of bread on something I may or may not wear much. A couple months back some sellers on the sub released a ‚Äúbudget batch‚Äù for Canada Goose jackets, and vests. After getting this thing in hand, and comparing to my langford, they really go hand and hand in terms of quality. Granted the langford is a lot more complex to replicate, and would still suggest going to Feiyu with a purchase of a jacket, but 3125 Tiger‚Äôs vest is up there in there in terms of quality. The collar has this beautiful material that‚Äôs level of softness matches that of the Nelly crewnecks everyone loves, the down located inside this vest immediately puffed up and gives a level of thickness that will keep any torso warm on a cold evening. The badge varies from what I have seen on other QC around the sub, (\*disclaimer, I am by no means an expert QCer) but I believe I got pretty lucky. The pockets on this bad boy are DEEP, you could easily fit a young child in them and still have room to spare, reminds me of the Places + Faces bag. The buttons have deep logo engraving, and are laced with some fatty YKK zippers. Once again, I am very impressed with this purchase, and suggest if you are on a budget and looking for CG, purchase this vest with confidence!  # The North Face Light Jacket  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/MeOX9Tu) |[ Fitpics](https://imgur.com/a/IJhyy1s)  [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=602554766964&spm=1101.1101.N.N.dd4f0a8)  Rating: 9/10  Price: $53.95  Another GP that I was happily surprised with. Initially when I got this in hand, I was disappointed that this was not a down jacket, as I intended to use this for snowboarding. After wearing this out for a couple of weeks, I have come to LOVE this jacket. Being a sort of windbreaker, it is a nice layering jacket that despite being as light as it is, still keeps you extremely warm. The claim of ‚ÄúGore-Tex‚Äù has held up pretty well to the times that I have worn this in the rain (has that affect where the water balls up and runs off). Being that it is probably just a coating on the jacket that will come off with time (similar to the shoe protection sprays) I am excited to how it holds up to the winter season of boarding. Looking at the embroidery, I do think it is a little sloppy on close inspection, but if someone is about to call me out for TNF i‚Äôll be really surprised. Again YKK zippers, and strong clasps on the hood, and inside on the bottom to taper the look against your body. Great quality for the price.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # ACCESSORIES:  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # Common Projects Achilles Low  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/smsukQs) |[ Fitpics](https://imgur.com/a/eRy5CKR)  [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=560811388969)  Rating: 9/10  Price: $44.14  Bought these last year, tried them on once, and sold them. These are more of a 12-12.5, but if you‚Äôre determined enough you can stretch these out to fit 12.5-13. The quality as many have reviewed before, is amazing, stamping is A+ on the side, only real flaw is the laces not being waxed as retails, but if that really bothers you, there‚Äôs a link floating around somewhere for accurate laces. Love these shoes to death despite being a tad too small, the initial breaking-in pain is totally worth it.  # Kaws x Baby Milo Figure  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/CvW0bIY)  [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=556824132652)  Rating: 10/10  Price: $13.23  Had to get another kaws figure, my first one was getting lonely.

Regular 141 Levis will not let this belt through the loops, but with some looser jeans it is possible. I have a pair of Volcom skate jeans that I wear on a daily basis and they fit nice and snug. Only problem is it does take a considerable amount of time to get it on and off. Tag on the backside of the belt looks extremely cheap and poorly stitched, but if you are going for the budget batch of this belt, you can‚Äôt complain.  # Burberry Underwear Pack  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/ZIFoOpG) |[ Fitpics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vkF-k56b2g)  [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=598087124891)  Rating: 7/10  Price: $9.42  Not very impressed with these, fairly thin, but get the job done. They are definitely on par with that one popular boxer sellers pairs, but a tad worse. On the plus side they do come in a pack of three, but you are better off buying some fruit of the loom or champion boxers for cheap.

For Sizing i would go TTS for a slightly Oversized Fit whilst still being able to rock with cargos or just joggers for the colder days - washed both and no colour has ran onto the white or from the black - worth noting that the collar is a tight collar which is ideal for an Oversized top as it maintains the shape of the upper half of the top.

Embroidery for the front logo and writing is on point, not a loose stitch out of place and honestly for the actual quality of the hoodie i couldn't be happier. In my current situation i had bought a Size S which is an Oversized M and for some reason i didn't use my common sense to order an M and didn't actually realise i ordered the wrong size until i tried it on - so i've sold this on FashionRepsBST and bought a size M which should be arriving in a mini haul at the end of the month.

PLEASE NOTE PANDABUY WILL NOW NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM HIS STORE; BLACKLISTED.  Review: CK Boxers - quality is standard, no smell, seems are double stitched to stop them from tearing, normal boxer leg length so happy with these, 9/10.  Tom Ford - quality is amazing on these to be honest, no smell, seams are stitched well and the elastic band is super nice and matches the one retail pair i own, these fit me the best out of the boxers i own retail or rep, 10/10.  Prada - quality is a bit meh, they fit too tight and the seam for your inside leg which connects to the back section of the boxer is in such a strange position that its actually uncomfortable, also the band for the prada logo is off, 4/10.  &#x200B;  Thanks all for tuning in, hope you enjoyed.  Dan - RootsReps420.  &#x200B;;;Hey mate, can I ask how you source your reps? Do you have a go to seller, or do you just do a search in weidian?","{upvote:2,timestamp:2023-10-10}",Reddit,0,

My first haul was just a mini 3.4 kg haul which included a few tees and some BM Lin budget creams as a test run. With this 40 kg haul I started ordering through WeGoBuy during CNY and the start of the Coronavirus situation so it took a little while for everything to get going. I decided to split the hauls between 9-10 kg for each parcel, so I have 2 more on the way while the last one is still waiting for items mostly from weidian. My entire wardrobe was kind of lacking so I decided to get a wide variety of items. After this I'm going to be very picky about the pieces I pick, this was mostly a lot of basic pieces  Parcel Stats  * Weight - 9.7 kg * shipped EMS * price - 995 yuan ($143 USD) * items: 26 * total price of items - $302 * shipped 2/21, received on 2/28  My stats:  * Height - 5'8"" * Weight - 150 lbs * Build - Average  Link to spreadsheet:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w6zDQf2XKmgy2DTlECDpLbHfpuiF3NnitPIFsizqslM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w6zDQf2XKmgy2DTlECDpLbHfpuiF3NnitPIFsizqslM/edit?usp=sharing)  Mobile friendly album of everything on spreadsheet: [https://imgur.com/a/cgoOUDD](https://imgur.com/a/cgoOUDD);;this man can FUCKING DRESSSSSSS  and the spreadsheet is fucking elite. thank you for this based jzimon.   the best part is that we got 3 more parts to go","{upvote:47,timestamp:2020-03-07}",Reddit,1,1

Prime knit is good quality, boost feels nice. Only noticeable flaw is on the box. It should have 6 sizes since it has V10 in the code. Other than that, great shoe totally worth it for the price  Boosmaster Lin Adidas Blue Tint Yeezy - Size 10.5 & 11  [W2C](https://www.cnfashionpub.com/product/p160-tosv2-%e4%ba%ae%e7%82%b9%e8%93%9d-%e6%9c%ac%e5%9c%b0%e7%9c%9f%e7%88%86%e7%b1%b3%e8%8a%b1adidas-yeezy-boost-350-v2-blue-tint-b37571/)  [Pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/iK1Dtpw)  10/10 - One of my favourites from this haul.

There was lots of glue stains on both the boost and primeknit. Also the boost isn‚Äôt the best, definitely more stiff than retail. Considering they were cheap can‚Äôt really complain, will probably use them for beaters.

Boost is really good and shoe is overall really comfortable. Again like all the other yeezy from BM Lin the primknit is really nice. Reason for the 9.5/10 is because I‚Äôm not 100% sure of the shape. Fits a bit more snug than retail, could be different sizing just unsure. Overall great cop, would definitely recommend.

The carbon fibre feels ok, could be better. There‚Äôs also a imperfection on the sole, just a slight cut or indent. Overall I feel like you could get a better pair from a different seller for a cheaper price.

The stitching around the collar and sleeves is also spot on. The biggest thing I was worried about was the shirt being thin and not very heavy but after holding both the reps are quite thick and heavy. They both fit quite boxy and a little bit oversized but not baggy. I‚Äôm 175cm and 65kg with an athletic build and I got S for rep and M for retail and they fit the same.

,"price,popular","Board Games List As some of you may know board gaming is sort of in a golden age lately.  Some of the best games have been produced in the past decade and the hobby has seen a surge in popularity.  Its a hobby of mine so I've been looking up board games I would like for myself and I saved the interesting ones into this list.  **Disclaimer:** I assume all of the board games in this list will be playable by an English audience.  Some of the games are fully in English but some are in Chinese.  In regards to the chinese versions of games I only included ones that had a chinese box and rulebook as the only components with chinese on them.  aka the board, cards and pieces are in english or they dont have any language on them at all.  So all you would have to do is print out the rulebook at home to have a complete game.  Also some of the sellers have no sales at all so buy at your own risk.  Of course I am making assumptions with some of these listings here so please review the listings for trustworthiness and english availability yourself before purchasing.  **Disclaimer:** I included a lot of small box games because the larger boxed board games are really heavy, like 1-2kg.  DO NOT ship big boxed games via expensive shipping methods like EMS or DHL since they will end up costing you more than a retail copy of the game.  Please do your cost research before purchasing since I do not want to be responsible when you overpay for a heavy game.  Some of the listings include the weight of the game but some do not.  For reference I bought Azul last year for 50y, about $7.87, but I ended up paying $18 in shipping via EMS lol.  The game retails for $26 shipped on amazon smh (at the time it was on sale for $33).  [Google Sheets Link Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gTDKKIbWjW046fn1lofvH_mKoCaQlfyMXZ2W0Q22Gic/edit?usp=sharing)  **I have sorted the list by how complex a game is.**  I determined this by viewing the ""weight"" rating (this doesn't mean how heavy the box is but rather how dense and complex the game is to grasp and play) found on boardgamegeek.com (this is the imdb of board games although their users do favor very complex strategic games more).  So the top of the list will have easy to play quick games that you can teach to anybody.  The bottom of the list is filled with very complex games that I do not recommend anyone who just wants to get a taste for the hobby to try out.  Also you can use this sorting to see what kind of game you like.  Do you want a game similar in complexity to cards against humanity then just find one in the list similar in rank to it.  You can find out game info about specific games on bgg and you can find videos on gameplay on youtube.    **""Phil, but why isnt my favorite game on this list?""**  A lot of the top games come in huge heavy boxes (gloomhaven, scythe) so I just rule those out unless its a dirt cheap price.  Nearly all of the board games are available on taobao but at retail prices;  very few are available for really cheap.  I have kept my eyes open for games that I have noticed on many recommended lists, top 100 lists, etc, but everyone's top list of board games is different so i may have glanced past some games I didn't recognize.  If there is anything that you have found or do find that isn't on the list please lmk and i will add it to the list.  **Methodology:**   I started by searching the chinese term for board games (Ê°åÊ∏∏) but it returned too many results and most of them were chinese.  So I added the term for english (Ëã±Êñá) so that I could see only english board games and those results were a lot better.  only 80 pages of results.  So I scoured those results and this is what I came up with.  I also did a search for the chinese characters of the terms export board games and united states board games but those search terms didn't yield much of anything new.  I searched using chinese characters because I wanted to see if there were any hidden gem listings that didn't have descriptive enough titles with full english phrasing.  If you have any ideas for other terms that I can search that might yield more results lmk.  If there is a game that isn't on the list but you would like to find it on taobao first type in the name in english.  Most of the american board games on taobao have the english name of the game in the title.  Next you should type the name of the game in google and find a clean product image of the box cover.   Reverse image search that.  Make sure to check out both the toys and other categories in your results.  If you ask me to find so and so game this is the exact process I would use so please just this method yourself.  (you can give a man a fish and feed him for a day, but teach a man to fish and he will be fed for life).    ;;Thank you for this list! ","{upvote:2,timestamp:2019-03-20}",Reddit,1,1

"Prada,Dior","price,haul","Old-School Haul Review PB Reviews  Ôøº  Here is my Pandabuy haul that took 27 days to arrive! Ordered with HK-UPS-B, took 14 days to get to HK, another week and a half in HK. Arrived to AK yesterday and arrived at my door on the East coast USA in 24 hours.   Ôøº  Overall, I‚Äôm satisfied with the haul despite how long it took to arrive. It‚Äôs the holiday season. Used a bunch of coupons and Black Friday deals so total cost on items was $455.40   Shipping with UPS-B at 15kg was $191 after coupons.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   Ôøº Ôøº Dior B23: Comes with box, documentation and extra laces. I would give it a GL. Only complaint is the shade of black on the lettering is a little greyer than retail IMO. But very very close. Stitching is good and presentation is 10/10. I‚Äôd give 9/10 overall because of the price.  https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=5317517913&spider_token=4572 ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   Ôøº Budget TS Stealth: The bandana it comes with is ASS. I‚Äôm about to throw it out. Some of the laces came a little tore up but I laced them up in a way to hide it. Some stitching was loose and the suede was kinda dead. Hit it with a suede brush and cut off some of the bad stitching and it‚Äôs solid. For the price its a solid GL. Overall: 7.5-8/10 https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=5417248459&spider_token=4572 ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   Ôøº Prada Sweater: I was a little concerned because the weight was really light, but turned out to be for the best. It‚Äôs super warm and might be full cashmere if not, 70/30 blend. The stitching is pretty good and it‚Äôs not pilling too bad. Only real complaint is the color on the lettering is a little yellower than retail. Sizing is pretty accurate. Sleeves are a little long but it‚Äôs supposed to fit that way.  Overall: 9/10  https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6673574157&spider_token=4572 ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   Ôøº Ôøº Ôøº Balenciaga Jersey Sweater: The sweater is thick but the fit, lines and coloring are off. The white accents look dirty from factory. Like its a dusty white, not crisp white which is disappointing. The sleeves are a bit short, it‚Äôs not unwearable but it is def short. The stitching itself is also not 1:1 and the font on the back is bolder than retail. Given the price, I don‚Äôt think this is acceptable. I‚Äôll get use out of it and wear it but not as happy with it as I thought I‚Äôd be.  Overall: 6.5-7/10  https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=731786815581 ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   Ôøº Manchester Balenciaga Hoodie: Coulda gone one size smaller but love this hoodie. Very thick and has the same oversized pockets as retail. The placement of the lettering might be low, but unless someone has a side by side I don‚Äôt think anyone is noticing. Only call out would be the distressing which is a bit more like claw marks then the scrapes on retail, but didn‚Äôt buy for 1:1 accuracy. Warm sweater and pretty heavy. Again, I got a size too big so it‚Äôs hella oversized but still a solid cop for the price.  Overall: 8.5-9 / 10 https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6477557541&spider_token=4572 ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   Ôøº Ôøº Be Kind Balenciaga Hoodie: It‚Äôs a little light, ngl. Def a SS hoodie. The wash is not 1:1 at all, but it‚Äôs the closest one I‚Äôve seen around. The embroidery is also the best I‚Äôve seen on a rep so far. The distressing is a bit deep on the hood compared to retail and looks like a factory, not hand done. Final complaint is the hood is WAY too small. I can‚Äôt put on the hood even though the rest of the hoodie fits perfectly. To be fair, I have big hair, but still. I think it‚Äôs the best version of this hoodie around but it‚Äôs not perfect.  Overall: 7.5 / 10 https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=740075879655 ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   Ôøº Ôøº Ôøº Be Different Balenciaga Hoodie: Really good hoodie. Cropped fit, with a giant hood, very comfy. I like the wash on it and the embroidery isn‚Äôt half bad. Can‚Äôt compare to retail since it‚Äôs such a rare hoodie, but I like it. 10/10 https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=684604340334 ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   Ôøº Yeezy x Gap Hoodie: The color isn‚Äôt accurate but come on, its yzy gap, nobody is testing u on this. What I will say is it‚Äôs the thickest and comfiest hoodie you‚Äôll ever put on. It‚Äôs literally two hoodies sewn into one. If you don‚Äôt mind the color being off, I‚Äôd say cop it. Tags are also wrong but idc bout that. Overall: 9/10 https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=5357460006&spider_token=4572 ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   Ôøº  Kaws x TNF Jacket : Disappointed. I think they just put the same amount of down in all the coats regardless of size and so the XL does not feel full or puffy enough. I‚Äôm gonna give it a few more days to fluff but so far it‚Äôs pretty dead. Also, this model has a hood. Online it‚Äôs marketed as detachable, IT IS NOT DETACHABLE! It rolls into the collar but this is not how retail is. The size and fit is good and the material isn‚Äôt too shiny which what most factories mess up. The decal itself is good and the embroidery is good. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you‚Äôre going for accuracy but it‚Äôs definitely not the worst option.  Overall: 7/10  https://detail.1688.com/offer/728254459593.html ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî;;Did you use the XMAS2023 coupons?

Overall, I used my measurements (I'm on the smaller side) to choose sizes and I was shocked overall that everything fit since most of the stuff I got, seemed like they would fit way bigger. In other words I feel like a lot of these size numbers aren't quite right. But I'm happy that the mediums that I bought fit perfectly.  I'll be rating out of 10, and anything that is 10 out of 10 means that I think it is both High Quality & that it Fully satisfied my standard for how any given thing looks  I'm 5' 10"" around 140 (skinny) and I traditionally wear size: small- medium. Everything ended up fitting as it should have.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=674492126034](https://preview.redd.it/um4trmu4wmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=254acfd5c4a1fd4f8d5a7a65d3b04e848de9c8ea)  **5/10  (0/10\***  **EDIT: (revising to 0/10 Do Not Recommend)**  **EDIT: After using these for about a week I've decided that I actually do not recommend these. I have crease protectors that I got off amazon (which I paid more for) and they are way better. These are thin and I thought they would be good enough, but while using them the sneakers I put them in still started to crease and when I swapped them out for my better quality ones I could see that it didn't even let the crease spot give. I'm actually kind of pissed because if I had just used the better ones those creases wouldn't have even developed. I know it may sound like I'm in too deep lol but I really don't like getting creases if I don't have to so I was disappointed. Even if you're not as into stopping creases as I am, these simply don't provide the rigidity that it should, which is the whole goal, so I would pass. In my opinion it's better to just opt for the better thicker ones (if you can get them locally/online) than these.**  Yall know what these are. They aren't the best crease protectors I've purchased but they'll do.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=690464863653](https://preview.redd.it/n3lspjr6wmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d76137cc39374cbe3593125331521858face796)  **9/10 (fit slightly small)**  This turned out to be one of my favorite sweaters. It seems accurate to the original and it fit perfectly. It feels ok but definitely looks way better in person than in it's pictures. I'm not a huge stone island fan but occasionally they have really dope pieces... this is one of those. I would say this is TTS.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=733533251161](https://preview.redd.it/zjj95pt8wmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d78b470649ed57c8eae4d5eb73c179960ad3223)  **7/10**  This lesser known Chinese brand sweater is really dope. As usual I don't REALLY care about a brand logo, I judge things based on look/quality and this did not disappoint at all. Especially at its price but not because of it. It feels really soft an while I thought the smallest size would be to large, fortunately it wasn't. I would say this is around TTS. I would have been completely happy if I could really tell it was a heart while wearing it but that might just be a result of my frame.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=724199107445](https://preview.redd.it/qseo1bbawmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d4f09490fc733afdede7e0d8f0be909168743bf)  **10/10**  LOVE this sweater. This is hands down going to be one of my fave sweaters. It looks just as it does in the pictures and the quality has to be basically identical to the original. If anything this has to be one of lacoste's better sweaters in general. It's not thick, it fit TTS and I highly recommend. Just don't get it if you live too close to me... lol gotta gate keep the drip ü§£. No but I really do like this get especially because its not an over the top brand and the price is insane considering.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=713167971961](https://preview.redd.it/zcr1ibtbwmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2bb47ab18746c0a301999755c1ef754bc16b9a6)  **8/10**  I spent a lot of time going back and forth on this rhude sweater and I'm glad I got it. I was about to skip it because the smallest size was Medium and the numbers seemed like it would have been way too big (i dont really dig the oversize look in my fashion). But I'm pretty sure those numbers are overstated because the medium fits me just slightly big. But that worked in my favor as I wanted it to fit close to regular. The quality is as it should be, very soft and thick sweater. I don't know the retail but it seems as it should be. I have no doubt that this is gonna wow ppl.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/weidian.com\/item.html?itemID=2696581017&spider\_token=4572](https://preview.redd.it/9dgfur3dwmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d7a656f9854ced1f9545cfdeb50237bf9805599)  **7/10 (if they didn't scratch a bit at the back it would easily be 9/10)**  I always like to have some slick boxers for nights that might turn interesting and these will do. They def feel quality but I will warn that there's a tag on the back that can be annoying. As in its scratchy. These fit TTS.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=709935605388](https://preview.redd.it/tgx25meewmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=478ffa899c517de40f241a27b42459debee598a4)  **7/10**  I love thom browne as a fashion house so this was a must buy. I've never seen a TB in person so I have no idea if the quality is similar. Overall it's nice, nothing to write home about necessarily as the sweater material itself doesn't feel like it has incredible quality, but it is nice enough. Out of ALL the stuff I bought this was the one I was least impressed by surprisingly and that's not to say it's bad, that's more a function of everything else being so good lol. It fits a little large on me but their ""size 1"" was the smallest I could get.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/weidian.com\/item.html?itemID=5739752140&spider\_token=4572](https://preview.redd.it/qdejhdsfwmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc12003126f569db603fb8f735e3246e0b5cf31a)  **8/10**  I was REALLY waiting for these. I knew I had to get these via PandaBuy as soon as I started buying with them. The asics court mz, In my opinion, is a sleeper of a sneaker. I have no idea how these haven't trended but it's my intent to make them trend. As far as quality, they seem almost 1:1. The only issue was that they came ever so slightly wrinkly in the front (you can actually see it a bit in the picture about) even though they shipped in the box fine. I'm assuming this is a manufacturing thing. That aside they have a really special place in my heart and I know I'm gonna kill mad fits with em. They're comfortable and like I say, they are unique as far as casual sneaker looks go. For the price I wish they didn't have that little bit of wrinkling in the front but I would with out doubt buy them again.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=732097211098](https://preview.redd.it/bfpuhpbhwmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7214ee84030987c8471cf94ea806e67b3f271557)  **9/10**  Bruh let me tell you, these are dippy AF. I know these are gonna end up being my fave sweats. I got small and they fit as they should, so TTS, and the quality feels insane. I'm actually surprised at the feel because I wouldn't think essentials felt that quality (never had them before), but I guess thats why they're around $200. The only think I'll say is that I'm not a fan of the screen print name, simply because I know these scrape off in general, but other than that these are keepers.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=684792297572](https://preview.redd.it/s0rea8riwmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=535b4704ef8bbd59b3f2a301a734283418fd218e)  **9/10 (for it potentially being a fantasy piece.)**  This is one of my sleeper sweaters. Another one that looked just as it should have according to the pics. It's a thick Margiela sweater and I personally have no doubt the quality is similar. It feels very high quality. I think someone pointed out that it might be fantasy, and when I looked it up the model definitely isn't as they have this same one in a burgundy, but still I couldn't find it in black. Trust me, I do not care lol. No one is going to check MMs inventory and everyone will be thinking... ""that's a nice as V-neck sweater"". Absolutely one of my favorites and is just another pieces which solidified this greatness of this haulü§£. It fit TTS and I recommend it, if you're not worried about it potentially being a fantasy piece.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=686868081247](https://preview.redd.it/ciyfol4lwmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d32f32c3ad732935369e53cd0461f1826c8ffd91)  **6.5/10**  Another chinese brand that I got because I liked it. Not much bad here. The material quality isn't the best and this has to be the piece in my collection that feels the worst, but it's certainly not the worst you can get. The detail is screen printing so I know it will chip off a little over time. Either way, it fit TTS and I'm glad to have it as a filler in the wardrobe.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/weidian.com\/item.html?itemID=6282618796&spider\_token=4572](https://preview.redd.it/d45cmryqwmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f07648376d239f611b0d1ae69a13977bfdad3f90)  **7/10 (screen printing a lil iffy, not really a big fan of the ribbed look, but that's on me)**  I had to have some HM hoodies and so I picked this up. I didn't really realize it was ribbed across its entirety, but that wasn't too much of an issue. I'm never a fan of screen printing and although it's thick I know it will start to chip real soon as a very small part of the front logo came chipped. After ironing it I'm sure it will look very good. It fit TTS and is a quite heavy sweater. I think its fine enough but knowing what I know now I would have just gone for another of the other HM sweater I got in this haul.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=610157874461](https://preview.redd.it/rmsdr84swmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9db22da84bf34451b8ea142ef1d361ce987507a)  **10/10**  Not much to say about these. They fit TTS (these were small), they fit just like I would expect yeezy sweats to fit and their quality seems on par. Very soft and puffy yet they keep their silhouette I def love these and have zero regrets!  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/weidian.com\/item.html?itemID=4428977916&spider\_token=4572](https://preview.redd.it/kcp5jdmtwmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=34162140e0755287661960bd698045423c4f56cb)  **?/10**  These seem great for the price but I have to do a bit more research. Up close the quality seems as it should but since I haven't seen the originals in person I still don't know how 1:1 they are so I'll reserve judgment.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=728464285393](https://preview.redd.it/czl4c5bvwmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9dbe66004826f06496bbc942cd527b3da742d18)  **10/10**  Bruhhh, when I start the review with bruh, just know... this my shit. These jeans are a F\*\*\*\* instant favorite of mine. The fit, the feel, the quality. I love every single thing about these jeans. I liked them so much I threw down a followup order just because I want the true black (purple jeans). I'm a big fan of black jeans and while I have a lot of distressed blacks and the completely black jeans (which im not exactly a fan of), I wanted a clean black jean look with minimal rips but a nice wash and these and the other ones fit that want PERFECTLY. I'm SUPER happy with this cop and highly recommend. They fit TTS (32).  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=723631536645](https://preview.redd.it/3iu6l67wwmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=84914b6d630cf139a56eaa1e623bf8da01a0cddf)  **10/10**  This is a sick AMI sweater. I have two others and this is hands down my favorite. In fact I wore it today and got a ton of looks. Its without doubt a quality piece, especially the thick fuzzy applique like logo that feels like its a piece of miniature carpet. It fit's TTS with AMI's classical bit of an oversized look. I can highly recommend, Imma have fun rocking this without doubt.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/item.taobao.com\/item.htm?id=625208690845](https://preview.redd.it/8ppe98mxwmnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=965646e820f4f37a7d967f18b57673d2b902a1ee)  **10/10**  I was concerned that these ""cashmere"" sweaters wouldn't pull through because they look fuzzy in some pics and really thin in others. They are not fuzzy but they feel like butter! No clue if they're actually cashmere but they certainly feel like it. I just wish I got even more so I could have more colors covered. I know for sure I'll definitely be back and these will def become my basics for cashmere tops. they fit TTS at least in the small range.  &#x200B;  [https:\/\/weidian.com\/item.html?itemID=4419284246&spider\_token=4572](https://preview.redd.it/a77mxwvqxmnb1.png?width=3990&format=png&auto=webp&s=63dadf88dbc4e34ba19a93da658d9fd4ab7c250c)  9/10 (damn screen printing should be abolishedü§£)  I added this to the haul last minute because it was super cheap  at ¬• 59, I assume because it was only in XS. Either way it fit TTS and actually ended up being the Human Made sweater that I liked the most. It's really thick like a superdry sweater and feels really quality. Again the only thing I don't like is these companies damn screen printing but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Outside of reps I don't know how they get away with charging $200 with... screen printing. Like can we get embroidery? I guess ppl can argue it's a different look, but no matter what screen printing just ends up reducing the quality for the most part. All of that rant aside I do love the sweater still and I'm super happy with the 8ish dollar buy. Insane deal!  # END OF HAUL  All in all, this was a banger of a haul. I have to say it was basically perfectly executed. I didn't have one disappointment other than maybe the crease protectors lol. All the looks are hit after hit and the quality matches that standard. I would recommend any of these pieces, with the only exception being MAYBE recommending going with one of the more reputable Thom Browne makers/stores like ([**TAYLOR BACK**](https://www.pandabuy.com/shopdetail?t=taobao&id=shop110534386&spi=110534386&sli=396769512)**).** Anyway, hope everyone enjoyed the show.

"Chanel,YSL","worth it,comparison","Perfume Guy Review: YSL - Y, Armani - Acqua Di Geo, Tom Ford - F**king fabulous, Chanel - bleu, Creed - Aventus # Welcome to my Perfume Guy Review. Please note, this review is completely unbias. I have no agreement with Perfume Guy to share this, I'm just doing this to share my experience and provide insight and feedback.   #### Please note, I sampled all the genuine fragrances and brought them home to compare with scent cards. Yes I know on skin and material is different.   ### Tom Ford - F**king Fabulous 30ml 1:3 Glass Bottle (4/10) This stuff literally is a chemical bomb. The alcohol content in it is so high and potent, you can't really grasp the smell until a couple of hours have passed at LEAST. When the fragrance has had a bit of time to diffuse, it keeps that element of 'older man' smell that the real thing has, but not really in the same tier. It smells fake if I'm being honest, and not really a close fake. It has that leathery-peppery smell that you'd expect, but the accuracy just isn't there. It almost smells expired. I sprayed some behind my ear before bed and the smell left on my pillow was sort of nice the next day. Would I recommend this to a group of guys who are 14-26? Absolutely not. Would I recommend this as a gift for some Uncle of yours who you could tell them it isn't genuine? Maybe.   ### Creed - Aventus  30ml 1:3 Glass Bottle (2/10) Easily the worst fragrance I got out of all 5. The chemical blast is still a huge factor with this one. It's so awful my friend and I pranked our friend with a couple of sprays on his shirt and he had to completely change and shower it was that unpleasant. I wish I was kidding. I personally couldn't find any real resemblance to the original fruity, tangy and rich smell, it just smells like chemicals you shouldn't be inhaling. I wouldn't recommend this as a gift, for yourself, or even as a joke in all honesty. I know it sounds harsh, but this is my honest opinion.   ### YSL - Y  30ml 1:3 Glass Bottle (5/10) It's bearable. It's definitely in the same ballpark in terms of smell as the genuine. I'm reading online that a lot of people pickup Apple in the genuine, which I didn't in the genuine and the replica. You definitely get the sage smell, and 'young forest' just comes to mind. The alcohol content once again is very high, but maybe the least high out of all 5. Once again, I don't think I can recommend this just because of the potency and the accuracy. It's really hard to explain through text, but the best way I can put it is; it's there, but it's not. If you wanted to buy this because you just want to try a new designer fragrance with no interest in buying the real thing and you're not wearing it to impress anyone, sure, get it. Looking to impress a girl, your friends, colleagues etc.? No. Get something genuine.   ### Armani - Acqua Di Geo  30ml 1:3 Glass Bottle (4/10) In terms of accuracy, I'd put it in the same category the Tom Ford was in. The genuine is very citrus-y smooth, very classy, very recognisable. This smells cheap and sweet from the first minute to the 8th hour. Alcohol content once again just blasts the living daylight out of your nostrils. If you know what the genuine is like and you like it, don't get this expecting the same thing. It's just not and you'll be disappointed unfortunately.   ### Chanel - Bleu  30ml 1:3 Glass Bottle (6/10) The best replica that I got out of the 5. It holds up quite well in terms of comparison to the real thing (after an hour or so of airing out of course, yes it still smells like nuclear fallout). I definitely get the sea kind of element and '25 year old chill dude' smell that the original reminds me of. It's not over the top, it's a bit on the sugary headache side, but I can't complain. Of course I can't say it's close to 1:1, but it's the closest. Maybe 0.74:1?  ------------------  I hate to say it, but if I could recommend you to pick between 1 x Genuine EDT fragrance or 5+ x Replica EDT/Parfum's, I'd strongly suggest the genuine. The biggest difference for all of them was the 'cheap' element you got. This isn't placebo either. I've worn replica clothing for years now and I've never felt 'cheap' until I tried on these fragrances. They're just not worth it. I'd literally recommend these to you if maybe if you lived on skid row and wanted to make your bando smell a bit more nice.   I'm interested in hearing any questions anyone has and would love to answer them. Let me know, and sorry Perfume Guy, this is just my opinion.;;Crazy because I feel my Tom Ford FF is a 9/10 Minimum. Smell and last soo good. Thanks for the review tho","{upvote:4,timestamp:2020-01-15}",Reddit,1,1

Dior,aesthetic,"Chez Pierre review (low karma user) Whats good repfam,  This is my first real post in general on reddit so please be considerate when it comes to mistakes. I bought 5 x 20ml bottles from u/peracar00 on his website for about 30‚Ç¨. I bought the perfumes in the 1:3 concentration and I don't think going over that ratio does the perfume any justice. The experience was quite nice as nothing spilt, the shipping was quick (to germany) and the customer service was really nice when I asked about my tracking number. I have none of these scents as the original so Im just gonna judge on behalf of my liking of the scent and not how accurate it is.  Lets get into it  **Summer Night (La Nuit L'homme) 6/10**  This is a typical date night scent and as you might guess your boy gets none of those things -\_-. It smells very sweet and in certain situations like a date this is the way to go to leave an impression but it doesn't last very long compared to the other perfumes and it smells a bit synthetic sweet.  **Hint of Vanilla (Tobacco Vanille) 10/10**  You're missing out if you don't include this into your order. Legitimately the best smelling perfume Ive ever owned and let me tell you why. The tobacco part of the scent spikes in the first 30 minutes and might seem a bit too aggressive but after it settles in this is my favorite vanilla smell. It gives me the vibe of a warm cozy fireplace in the winter with vanilla in the air. A kid at my job said I smell like the best version of vanilla dessert and that is so true. Using 1 spray I can still smell it on me the next because the longevity is just that good.  **Wild Bergamot (Dior Sauvage) 8/10**  Fresh is the word to describe this fragrance in my opinion as it has the freshest smell out of all the scents I ordered. This became my sport fragrance because it smells really fresh and clean while the bergamot still makes it a bit spicier so you can stand out. Lasts about 5-6 hours noticeably and then settles down.   **In Space (Spicebomb) 7/10**  As the original name says this smells like 30 spices concluded and put together in just one bottle and it really does the trick. Jasmine, cedar wood, white musk and ciste are just a few of the components to make it a confusing good fragrance. I never know what exactly Im smelling in this fragrance but I just feel like it all fits very well together. The smell itself is not really for me and I still believe it is a 7/10 for me so that should be all there is to say. The longevity is a lil worse compared to wild bergamot.  **Day Light (Dylan Blue) 8/10**  Last but not least the rep version of the all so well known Dylan Blue. This fragrance really fits the aesthetic of a very formal job interview. I would wear this when meeting your girlfriends dad because this smell screams ""I have a put together life"". It is not sweet at all just so you know. The typical male fragrance I would say. Lasts very long in the range of 6-8 hours.   &#x200B;  Thats it for the review I just wanted to say that you should buy from Chez Pierre as he is a great guy and his fragrances are so budget friendly. If you liked my review please leave an upvote as I need it lol  Have a good day;;The hint of vanilla is too on the nose for me, smells like a bakery. The Creed impression however at 1:2? Best scent I‚Äôve ever had.","{upvote:5,timestamp:2021-12-29}",Reddit,1,1

Adidas,"quality,comparison","‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ The Ultimate Guide To Legit Checking (Fake Vs Real) ANY Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Colourway - even unreleased Hello repfam,  Since there are so many colourways of Yeezy 350 V2 out there now (and more coming), we've put up this guide that is an all-around legit check guide **for all colourways**.  How is that possible? Some flaws apply regardless of boost soles differences or materials used. So even on the yet-unreleased Lundmark Yeezy, these flaws will still apply because of the factory equipment fake manufacturers use.  If you prefer a better experience than what Reddit allows us to do, please check the link here: [https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/complete-guides/fake-vs-real-yeezy-boost-350-v2/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/complete-guides/fake-vs-real-yeezy-boost-350-v2/)  Over there I'm able to put up more properly-sized pictures, do better heading structuring and facilitate quick navigation from the table of contents at the top.  Here's the guide.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîHow to tell fake vs real Yeezy Boost 350 V2Step 1: Scan the barcode of the box label to see if the barcode test is passed.  Remember what we‚Äôve written above about fake manufacturers and their process? When they replicate the box label, they don‚Äôt care that much about the barcode.  Why should they?  No one who buys fakes ‚Äúwears‚Äù the box. Replica creators would rather focus on the shoe. Therefore, 95% of the fakes will fail this quick test, hence I recommend you start with it.  >*How will we tell fake from real through the barcode test, you may ask? You will want to check whether the barcode matches on the box you‚Äôre checking matches the other authentic barcode labels on the market.*  [The barcode test has its own article](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/adidas/yeezy/350-v2/barcode-scan/) where we‚Äôre explaining the full situation. Below, we‚Äôll put together just the basics ‚Äî if some things are unclear, make sure you read that as well.  Let me explain.  For every size and colourway combination, there‚Äôs **one** specific code combination. There is one certain barcode for Yeezy Boost 350 V2, Sesame colourway, size US7.  Then, there‚Äôs another one barcode for the same Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Beluga, size US8. And so on. All these serial numbers are unique.  What we‚Äôll do, to put it shortly, is: we will search for the barcode number of the pair we‚Äôre authenticating, to see if it matches the barcode on other authentic pairs.  Why would we do that? Fake Yeezy Boost 350 V2 pairs have the wrong barcode. Let us show you a quick example, but make sure you read the bigger article if any part is confusing.  An example of the barcode test for Yeezy Boost 350 V2  First, go to our app‚Äôs home screen and use this button:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/cv94uz2y94831.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5bcd990601f529f679fee8fd1baa8db200d44d6  Once you do that, point the camera at the barcode you‚Äôll be authenticating.  As soon as a serial number is recognized, a Google search page result will pop up.  Here‚Äôs where you have to judge for yourself ‚Äî if there are some or a lot of confirmations on Google for the code you‚Äôre searching, the box is authentic.  Here‚Äôs how a Yeezy barcode scanner test would look like, for the sake of an example.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/rjgvzx30a4831.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=123caa2b1c0c45d4c92f356c26b1725c8ea670fc  Let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre barcode scanning these Yeezys above. Point the camera at the serial number over there.  Here‚Äôs what the result page will show:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ijdspvl0a4831.png?width=430&format=png&auto=webp&s=42465bb8cec2467d491e71a07e0a79fb6f8fec03  This is what a confirmation point is. One result showing the exact colourway and size you‚Äôre testing.  As you can see in the case above of the Yeezy barcode scan, all four results are confirmation points. If we scroll down, we‚Äôll see more of them.  This box is authentic!  Step 2: Compare the box label  This is yet another quick way to tell between fake and real Yeezy Boost 350 V2 trainers.  Once again, it‚Äôs a micro-detail that replica manufacturers don‚Äôt really care ‚Äî yet it‚Äôs highly valuable for us when authenticating a pair.  It can save minutes (if not hours) as multiple counterfeit Yeezy pairs fail this.  Notice that highlighted V10 text. That number will vary (it will say either V02, V03 or V10), but what we care about is the number of sizes we see on the left side.  More specifically, we need to see whether the number of sizes is paired with the right V02/V03/V10 number on the Yeezy box barcode label.  3 squares with sizes means we‚Äôre looking at the US version of the Yeezy Boost 350 V2.  6 squares with sizes means we‚Äôre looking at either the European or the Canadian box of the Yeezy Boost 350 V2.  How is this becoming helpful? Counterfeit Yeezy boxes mix these combinations up. If it seems complicated, don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôve got you.  Here‚Äôs the correct map:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/csshyhp1a4831.png?width=819&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f0767b4cacfe5b5cb1debc46409c6b3f6045629  And here‚Äôs a fake box with the wrong combination.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/f4xukjh2a4831.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc714eaae1c23def67d4e2194aeecf7340385f3b  If you see 3 size squares paired with the V10 text, that‚Äôs instantly a fake Yeezy box.  If you see 6 size squares paired with the V02 or V03 text, that‚Äôs instantly a fake Yeezy V2 pair.  Step 3: Look out for inconsistencies or misprints on the size tag.  Every Yeezy colourway has different sets of inconsistencies/misprints on their size tags.  But just like the old saying, we‚Äôll teach you how to fish, rather than giving you a fish.  We‚Äôll take the example of the fake vs real Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Butter size tag comparison and show you the reasoning behind spotting a replica pair.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/zdmbp6e3a4831.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f498ffa5e2b024e95056491e9412c25d0a03133  What we need to look out for here is any misprint, inconsistency or anomaly.  In other words, spot the difference between the higher quality printing machines Adidas used and the lower quality machines the fake manufacturers have used.  Example 1  Let‚Äôs take for example the #6 highlight. Notice on the fake size tag how the ‚Äú1‚Äù, ‚Äú/‚Äù and ‚Äú3‚Äù are very close to each other. Not only that, but you can barely read the ‚Äú3‚Äù on the fake.  That will never happen on an Adidas size tag.  Example 2  Look at the ‚ÄúJP‚Äù text in the ‚ÄúUS UK FR JP CHN‚Äù row. Notice how the authentic size tag has perfectly straight lines on both letters. On the other hand, fake Yeezy size tags are too fuzzy.  Example 3  Pay attention to the spacing between characters. Notice the ‚Äú275‚Äù below JP or the 265 below ‚ÄúCHN‚Äù.  Can you sense the randomness between the space between those characters? Comparing it to the authentic size tag shows us that the authentic counterpart has perfect spacing.  We have individual analyses on multiple Yeezy Boost 350 V2 colourways, so make sure you download the app so you can find out the exact specific size tag of the colourway you‚Äôre looking to authenticate.  Step 4: Make sure the Yeezys are laced properly  This applies without any exception to unworn (deadstock) pairs.  It can also apply to worn pairs but your judgement is required: it‚Äôs possible in 1% of the cases that the Yeezy Boost 350 V2 laces were taken off and re-laced in the wrong manner.  Nonetheless, it‚Äôs an instant tell for a fake vs real comparison. The photos are inverted so that it‚Äôs easier to understand the fake vs real.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/1fmy17b4a4831.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6d0e8ea58329d12bd8475ebded6b40c5e3be09  Let‚Äôs recap just to be clear:  >*Authentic Yeezy Boost 350 V2 lacing:*   *The right shoe should have the right lace underneath.*   *The left shoe should have the left lace underneath.*  This fake vs real tell applies once you‚Äôre looking from the top, so remember to revert, depending on the angle from which you‚Äôre looking.  >*Fake Yeezy Boost 350 V2 lacing:*   *The right shoe might have the left lace underneath.*   *The left shoe might have the right lace underneath.*  The replicas get at least one of the two wrong. Sometimes both ‚Äî however, I haven‚Äôt seen any original pairs come laced properly from the factory.  Step 5: Check the fake boost sole VS real boost sole comparison  The boost sole comparison is a bit of a complex matter. Once again, we‚Äôre going in-depth into every colourway, since Adidas changes the processes and techniques behind the creation of these soles every now and then.  To make sure you get the very-specific fake vs real comparison, use our app‚Äôs to get to the desired colourway. But as we‚Äôve promised, here‚Äôs an overall comparison.  The boost sole was quite hard to replicate for the counterfeit manufacturers. At least in the beginning.  In the meantime, Adidas ramped up the production of this model (the 350 V2s) and wild fluctuations started appearing on the authentic boost soles.  Nonetheless, differences can be spotted. Let‚Äôs start with a picture.  Boost pellets fake vs real  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/urxgw8b5a4831.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a1f88443ea18f896ba53845b858c90d589f6f34  One difference that applies to all Yeezy Boost 350 V2 fake vs real tests are the following two:  * on retail pairs, boost pellets have more of a rounded shape, they‚Äôre more ‚Äúbubbly‚Äù ‚Äî they also come in much more rounded shapes. * on fake pairs, boost pellets are less defined shape-wise and come in more oval/angular shapes.  What we see on the left side is a very smooth boost sole, yet there are also very defined soles. Ideally, if you‚Äôll be exposed to enough fake boost soles, you‚Äôll get a feeling of this.  Striped circles comparison  On the boost sole, you can start noticing these circles with 3 or 4 stripes. See them below:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/pl1aer66a4831.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb87e5b48977c6be2b70e45c32918dad240c58ef  Both fakes and authentic pairs have sometimes more than 3 stripes within these circles, but legit pairs tend to have these stripes arranged more orderly.  What we recommend here, once again, is to go to the detailed breakdown of authentic vs replica within our app on the specific colourway you‚Äôre looking to check.  This way, we‚Äôll give you more targeted advice, predicated on the type of boost sole Adidas released.  Step 6: See if there are any extra tags  We‚Äôll call ‚Äúextra labels‚Äù what you‚Äôll see below on this pair of Yeezy Boost 350 V2.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/yzf4xky6a4831.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6c2c8ce562a11f147c15257f656567ea057155e  On the left side, you‚Äôll notice the extra labels that usually come with the EU/Canada pairs. The European/Canadian pairs have 6 sizes on the box label.  Any Yeezy Boost 350 V2 released before the Static colourway coming with this extra label is likely to be an authentic.  It‚Äôs not a deciding factor, but fake manufacturers haven‚Äôt caught onto replicating this label on any release **up to the Static version**.  If you‚Äôre confused about the order in which colourways were released, check our app. All Yeezy Boost 350 V2 colourways are listed there and arranged chronologically (in other words, sequenced as they were released).  For pairs released after the Yeezy Static colourway, you‚Äôd need to pay attention to:  * the quality of the text‚Äôs print ‚Äî look out for any inconsistencies * the barcode on the extra label and the barcode on the box label ‚Äî they should match don‚Äôt forget to [scan the barcode as well!](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/adidas/yeezy/350-v2/barcode-scan/))  Step 7: Accessories that come with the box of the Yeezy 350 V2  While it‚Äôs not common practice these days anymore, some fake boxes will come with extra trinkets within the box.  It‚Äôs highly likely that you‚Äôll be able to authenticate faster and better through the other points above, but just to make the situation clear, any of the following being placed within your box of Yeezys should instantly qualify the pair as a fake.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/wc1hm2u7a4831.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dc9ef85af329d33d5cea73583e2776643c24e6e  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/49fd3p48a4831.png?width=819&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd1a9ae23fcc148521d6b101185e62b4e615ee25  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/bva7abg8a4831.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=25853e378b8e5c44e37b3a1cdca36d7969ac2e4a  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ryx284u8a4831.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=98bc81c97c1c5aa100720b48bb5d2e2ab1b65d54  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/98iygw79a4831.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=301f97ec7ca88cf4c1785fd07be881bf7996f605  This paper above should never be perfectly folded. Authentic Yeezys come wrapped in this yellow-cream paper.  With that being said, how can I tell fake vs real in 10 seconds?  While the full guide is long, we‚Äôve synthesised how to tell fake vs real Yeezy Boost 350 V2 in a couple of seconds. Here‚Äôs how:  1. Scan the barcode, see if it matches other authentic pairs. 2. If the pair is unworn, pay attention to the way the Yeezys are laced. 3. Check out the V02, V03 or V10 text, in combination with the number of sizes on the box label. 4. Look at the size tag, see if there are any inconsistencies in the text or the print quality. 5. Compare the boost sole to pairs you know are 100% authentic.  This is a recap of what we wrote above. If you‚Äôre in a face-to-face meeting with someone and you have doubts regarding the authenticity of the pair you‚Äôre almost buying, we‚Äôve got you covered.  That‚Äôs why we made the app: so that a specific section you‚Äôre doubting (whether it‚Äôs the size tag or the box label) is a few clicks away, in an instantly delivered (and curated) manner.  This way you won‚Äôt have to scroll through this whole guide. Make sure you download the app!  Bottom line  Again, this is the general guide for LCing any V2 colourway. We've also got specific comparisons (fake Bred size tag vs authentic Bred size tag, for instance) for multiple colourways, though not all.  Make sure you download the app to have a nicer experience of accessing all these guides ([https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/)) ‚Äî it's free and will always be like this.  If you think you can write guides or do comparisons, PM me. We might even pay, if the guides are good.  Hope it will help!  ‚Äî  Buy safely,  Ch Daniel;;I don‚Äôt understand.. don‚Äôt we already know pairs we get are fake and not retail? So why this fake v real test?","{upvote:8,timestamp:2019-07-04}",Reddit,0,

Prada,price,"Important statement--I will never provide UV400 protection testing service to anyone! Recently some ppl asked me if I would provide UV400 protection testing service and my answer is NO. Reason is simple, how much reliability it would be for a seller to self-claim a testing result? Further more I noticed some ppl requested seller to deploy UV400 protection testing with the equipment that only costs $27, which is half price of a rep wallet and the professional equipment  will cost around $11940...lmao.....  I wouldn't say any further cuz we are all sellers. Put myself in your shoes I strongly recommend you to do the UV 400 protection testing in your local optical store and normally that will be free of charge, one of fam copped a Prada shades from me and did that test in his local optical store and the result is 100% uv400 protective and with polarized. Wearing a bare lens with no UV 400 protection is not as bad as getting called out of a rep wallet,  you guys are white ppl (I would say mostly) and your pupil is much less  resistant to UV  than Asian or African ppl, that is why even Asian baby can safely play around under blatant sunshine without any protection. In a word don't ask any seller to do that meaningless UV 400 testing for you, I confirmed with the taobao seller of this $27 UV400 testing equipment and his answer is "" it's mostly a toy, don't take it for real.....""  here is the screenshot from taobao  [https://imgur.com/a/5O1AVzz](https://imgur.com/a/5O1AVzz)  &#x200B;  The intention of this post is not to screw anyone, just want to reveal the truth to you guys and this is Sam always be!;;So basically all the ""UV test proofs"" Aooko sent to people or has on his yupoo are faked?

"Louis Vuitton,LV","quality,price,thoughts","Louis Vuitton Skate 2.0 Sneakers From Koala [REVIEW] [REVIEW] Louis Vuitton Skate Sneakers From Koala (Latest version 2023)  Good evening, everyone, here‚Äôs a review on my Louis Vuitton Skate sneakers from Koala in the all black colorway.I know these are pretty rare and hard to get at the moment so i decided to make a review.  They came in last week and when I opened them up I was pleasantly surprised:  * The rep feels like a very solid good quality leather, it‚Äôs not flimsy at all and has a good density to it.  * Outer parts are made of leather, it‚Äôs probably a regular cowhide one - good leather, nothing to complain about. I‚Äôve worn them about 4-5 times and leather doesn‚Äôt seem to have any creases after my thorough inspection.  * Soles are surprisingly soft,it doesn't feel like some cheaper budget lv replica trainers i've worn in the past.This might be the comfiest rep sneaker i've ever owned.  * Overall structure is something I‚Äôve only saw in authentic high-end products.Shoes feel very well made,sturdily put together and pretty heavy.I can‚Äôt explain the feel of it due to my poor vocabulary,but I haven‚Äôt gotten that feeling when I was unpacking Jordan reps or any designer sneaker reps I own.  * Comfort: well, assuming these are designer sneakers which practically always lack it - it‚Äôs pretty good and, to say more, they‚Äôre more comfortable than Yeezy sneakers to me because these Louis Vuitton Skate sneakers have a wider toebox compared to Yeezy sneakers.  * My thoughts: I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve picked them up, because now I have a good pair of shoes to match with my more simple outfits,the price is a little expensive but considering the quality i got compared to other sellers that sell the previous version (loads and loads of terrible Louis Vuitton Trainers replicas out there) I think it‚Äôs bearable,since the shoe is very well made plus they met all of my expectations and beyond.   I hope someone will find my review useful and will enjoy them as much as I did, have a nice evening, guys!

Since lots of you are not sure what size to get of these popular shirts, this review may be of use. Perhaps you may consider this as a sizing guide (lol). Everything is from LY. Shipped with DHL Triangle and arrived in 16 days to Europe.  Stats: 175 cm and 83kg (big chesticles and boulder shoulder build)  __Balenciaga Campaign T-shirt (XS, fits like slim fit large)__  The quality on this is spot on and 1:1. The blank feels luxurious and thick. It‚Äôs the perfect oversized shirt if I took the right size. But I didn‚Äôt. If you hit the gym regularly and bulk like a mad man, take your regular size even if the length scares you. It is still tight around the arm pits.  __Balenciaga Apricot T-shirt (S, fits like medium)__  This one fits better, but it is still ‚Äútoo slim fit‚Äù in the sleeves. It is slightly shorter lengthwise than the campaign t-shirt. Don‚Äôt be afraid to order your regular size. Regardless, still a great t-shirt and the print does not peel after washing. However I won‚Äôt be able to wear this comfortably. So if anybody is interested in the Balenciaga tee‚Äôs, let me know ;)  __Louis Vuitton Monogram Flower T-shirt (L, TTS)__  This tee is 10/10 and accurate. The blank is thick and heavy, but still breathable. If you‚Äôve ever owned retail LV t-shirts, you recognise the ‚Äúcold and stretchy aspect‚Äù of the blank. The print stays on after a few washes, and I don‚Äôt think it will ever peel off. Design wise, this is my fave piece from LY.

,"quality,haul,comparison","Rep vs. retail: Represent Owner‚Äòs Club Tee UnionKingdom Hi guys, thanks to the Represent Black Friday sale I ordered some OC shirts, so I can compare them to the ones I ordered from Union Kingdom.  General: Powder blue is UK, the‚Äúgreener‚Äú one is retail. UK is size S, retail XXS. You can compare them directly because they have the exact same dimensions: ~54 cm (1/2 bust) and 70-71 cm length  Fit: as mentioned before, dimensions are the same, fit is perfect on both of them. Retail neck is a tiny bit tighter, but UKs is worn several times, so maybe that‚Äôs the reason. Not noticeable.  Quality & weight: both are premium, I personally don‚Äôt feel a difference materialwise, both super soft and the structure of the material looks identically. Rep is a little heavier, 237 v 220, could be because of different colours.  Backprint: it‚Äôs nearly impossible to get a rep with good back placement. UK nailed it. Check the pictures, letters have the same height, placement is almost the same, retail print is a little bit more compact, but definitely not noticeable.  Front print: the biggest flaw in my opinion, rep is a little bigger, placement is very good. I doubt that anybody could identify this.  Metal Tag: very very good  Inside tags: no ‚ÄûEngland‚Äú what you can see on almost every rep, so definitely ok (I don‚Äôt care about the inside tags but want to mention it)  Conclusion: really impressed with the quality and the accuracy of the shirt, a very good tee which feels amazingly. Retail is usually 115‚Ç¨, the rep is ~20‚Ç¨ and 28‚Ç¨ with insurance and shipping in a standard haul to Germany.  P.s. I am not paid for this review, never got any discounts or something like that. Unionkingdom doesn‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm doing a rep vs retail.  Hope you enjoyed this little comparison. Feel free to ask for further information.  W2C: Union Kingdom yupoo;;Awesome review!

They‚Äôre all one size socks, have no idea if they‚Äôre flawed but they fit well and I get lots of compliments so ya u should cop cuz they‚Äôre all dummy cheap and easy flexes.  üì∑  üì∑  üì∑  üì∑  üì∑  üì∑  üì∑  **Shorts/Pants:**  **Unbranded Black Cargo Pants 149¬•**  * Sizing: I got an XL (33) and they fit well, shrunk a bit in the wash * Fit: The pant legs aren‚Äôt quite long enough (I‚Äôm 6‚Äô) but I like them anyways. If you‚Äôre a short boi these are prolly fine for u, if ur taller then be prepared to have them sit a little above the ankle. Also, they have a little velcro strap on the ankles which I like a lot cuz it makes them fit slim on the bottom and baggier near the waist. * Compliments: Yes, tons of compliments and they all ask where I got them * Rating: 9/10 * Cop? Ya they‚Äôre sick pants  üì∑  üì∑  **Unbranded Brown Cargo Pants 88¬•**  * Sizing: I got an XL, fit well * Fit: Fit slimish, I like the fit a lot. Pant legs aren‚Äôt quite long enough but I cuff my pants and wear them shorter anyways so I don‚Äôt care. These ones don‚Äôt have the velcro on the ankle. * Compliments: Uh huh, same as the other cargos * Rating: 9/10 * Cop? I would say so  üì∑  üì∑  **Palace YangYang Shell Shorts** (Navy) 108¬•  * Sizing: Got an XL. * Fit: Probably should've gotten my normal size (Large) cuz they fit a little baggy but they work. * Flaws: they're super basic shorts so prolly pretty close to 1:1, but I also don't know what real ones feel like. the tags were good. * Compliments: Yeah, they're cool and the Palace is a chill flex. * Rating: 9/10 * Cop? Yeah, they're solid summer shorts.  üì∑  **Bags/Accesories/Other:**  **Off-White 6ft Industrial Belt** (Black) 88¬•  * Sizing: have to wrap it around twice or it hangs too much and the flex is too loud * Compliments: YA IM WEARING AN OFF WHITE BELT AND I PUT THE TAGS ON MY LANYARD TO FLEX EVEN HARDER * Flaws: Don‚Äôt know don‚Äôt care, quality is good enough for me * Rating: 10/10 * Cop? Ya unless u realize sum flaw that i missed  üì∑  **GOYARD CARD HOLDERRRRRR** (Navy) 38¬•  * Sizing: PERFECT * Fit: PERFECT * Compliments: HAVENT RECEIVED IT YET BUT IM STOOPID STOKED * Flaws: COOL THING ABOUT THIS ONE IS THAT ITS PERFECT 1:1 * Rating: ‚àû /10 * Cop? YES, I INITIALLY THOUGHT I‚ÄôD BE GAY FOR BUYING IT BUT NOW REALIZE I‚ÄôD BE 200% MORE GAY IF I DIDN‚ÄôT BUY IT  üì∑  **Sad Pepe the Frog Stickers 8.80¬•**  * God bless the man who put these in his haul, never would have thought to cop but they‚Äôre kinda dope and cost nothing and are probably the flexiest stickers one could ever buy.

The distributor is a popular seller. I really dont want to get refund because the OG version is very very good, but; what do you recommend to me?? Please if someone is in the same situation as me with this seller please talk to me. The seller said to me that the were doing a placement with the factory 3 days ago, but they still havent send the sneakers to my agent.  Please if someone has a OG Nike Sacao 3.0 link, put the link in comments.","{upvote:1,upvoteRatio:1.0,timestamp:2023-05-27}",Reddit,1,0

They fit very well and quality wise are great too. They look 1:1 to retail.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God Sixth Season Floral Shorts**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.1-c-s.w4024-16748274130.1.473e2265OKvaAW&id=555187170374&_u=c1eunt5259a&scene=taobao_shop)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/eHo2Lg6) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/IvOAlAJ)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Beige  * Price: $9.50   These are amazing. Quality definitely surpassed my expectations, they're made of a super comfortable fine mesh material. Accuracy wise these seem to be really strong apart from the zippers not having ""fear of god"" engraved on them as well as the inside tag is from a no name company.  **Overall: 10/10**  &nbsp;  **Unbranded Paisley Shorts**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=2870210327&a=b&wfr=BuyercopyURL&share_relation=4e0d67be0af669ae__1)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/hM9mG3D) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/6gaeb95)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Black & Gray  * Price: $7.31  Quality of these is decent, the fit is really good but they are made of a really weird nylon material that feels really cheap. They look cool though.  **Overall: 5/10**  &nbsp;  #Pants  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God Ghost Camo Pants**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.999.14.21be523cbSp5PU&id=618500980155&ns=1#detail)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/rBac457) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/ezoHqmv)  * Size: Sized Down (S)  * Color: Gray  * Price: $31.83  Quality wise these pants are really solid, the material is a good denim. The only complaint I have with these is that even though I sized up the waist is MASSIVE. I'm going to get them tailored then they should be good. Accuracy wise these aren't awful but they are far from 1:1. Starting out with the gray color it is noticably darker than retail, the ""fear of god"" logos in the denim are super faded and are pretty much not visible.   Edit: I got them tailored and these are one of the favorite pieces I‚Äôve ever copped once they fit. They fit baggy for sure but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd expect from any fog piece. Super high quality and the only gripe I have with them is that the only pockets on these are Velcro so whenever I want to put something in its loud as fuck. Plus once something like my phone is in the pants it weighs them down a ton and I have to keep readjusting the belt so they don‚Äôt fall down.  **Overall: 7/10**  **UPDATED SCORE 10/10**  &nbsp;  **Gallery Dept.

These are definitely 1:1 as all retail pieces have randomized paint splatters. The gallery text looks good. Not a whole lot to say about these I'm just in love with the design.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **AMIRI Paint Splatter Distressed Jeans**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.1-c-s.w4004-23108456496.49.1eee1300cetf5i&id=618934882467)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Eu0yqM6) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/3asfMvP)  * Size: Sized up (31) I normally take a 29  * Color: Black  * Price: $26.31  Compared to the pics on the store page I got shafted and I'm not sure if its just by luck or what but the store pics have a lot more streaks of paint but I got more splatters and dots. Fit wise these are tight and if anyone else would want to buy I'd reccomend sizing up three sizes. Also these fit skinny which I'm not used to so It's somewhat uncomfortable but I'm fairly certain I can get used to it.  **Overall: 6/10**  &nbsp;  #Crewnecks and Long Sleeves  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God Essentials Crewneck (x2)**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.6f882e8dL8cZOu&id=609557178678&_u=g3rb200hc8dc)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/31ywdVq) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/CsiajD2)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Beige & Gray  * Price: $12.43 each  These are great. Super comfortable blank, amazing oversized fit, very minimal branding, and the only thing I can pick at accuracy wise between these two is the gray crewneck's cuff edges seem to be slightly miscolored but other than that these are perfect.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God Essentials High Collar Mock Neck**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=627201742749)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/tMno5AV) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/2VM1ke1)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Black  * Price: $22.68  I love the fit of this piece, perfectly oversized FOG fit. I originally ordered the gray green color and I was sent the wrong color and was refused an exchange. The black colorway is still really nice though absolutely no complaints.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Kith mini logo long sleeve shirt**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=623556732746)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/ZiU4ymw) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/7sN2j4k)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Light Blue  * Price: $12.41  This piece is insanely thin and fits way too big. Gonna get it tailored and after that I think it will be decent at best.  **Overall: 4/10**  &nbsp;  **Kith x Coca Cola Crewneck**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.1-c-s.w4004-17080473757.12.465693918eOmex&id=605439218743)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/wGFeS9x) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/SfLCLcN)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: White  * Price: $18.69  Super comfortable fleece lining although it is on a pretty thin blank. Fits oversized. The embroidery is pretty shit but from a distance looks fine but close up its super messy and has a lot of exposed spots and loose threads.  **Overall: 7/10**  &nbsp;  #Windbreakers  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God Essentials Reflective Windbreaker**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3948163902&spider_token=dcee)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/QxiwB8Q) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/ssyr7b8)  * Size: Sized Down (S)  * Color: Silver (reflective)  * Price: $14.49  The fit is really good and oversized. From my original QC pics it looked like the essentials badge was super crooked but in person its fine. Whenever you move in it it's so fucking loud its pretty much unbearable to wear indoors. Also I can't state how awful it smelled out of the bag but after a wash it was fine.  **Overall: 7/10**  &nbsp;  #Footwear  &nbsp;  **Nike x Peaceminusone Paranoise AF1**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3344366024&spider_token=803c)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/gallery/NURJEBG) | [In-Hand and without paint](https://imgur.com/gallery/BcG38To)  * Batch: H12  * Price: $61.06  Absolutely in love with these. Definitely a criminally underrated pair. The primary flaws are the paint streaks on the midsole and the paint underneath is slightly too dull. If you're willing to shell out more money go with OG batch which is more accurate but will run you double.  **Overall: 10/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike x Travis Scott Sail Air Force 1**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3333472335)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/qDKjxXM) | [In-Hand with 3M](https://imgur.com/a/ZkH9Qib)  * Batch: H12  * Price: $53.61  Definitely one of the higher ranking travis collabs. Only large flaw I can pick out is the weak 3m around the eyelets although it is more noticable in person than on cam.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike x Travis Scott SB Dunk**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3604350235)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/a3QC3JT) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/CBykhMS)  * Batch: 290 cny batch  * Price: $43.19  Probably my second favorite travis shoe the first being the 1 Lows. These look great to my untrained eye.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike x CLOT Air Force 1**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3553595949)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/zGb7B32) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/RiZ8NM6)  * Batch: unknown  * Price: $34.25  In the original QCs taken by WGB its impossible to tell but in person the soles of the two shoes are noticably different colors. The tongue of the shoe is a stiff leather and it's uncomfortable against my ankles. Also the tongue squeaks a lot when it rubs against the shoe which gets annoying pretty quick. They look clean AF tho  **Overall: 7/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike x CPFM Vapormax**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3781843383&spider_token=db41)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/6qLE5q2) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/pIOXZqx)  * Batch: Wood Table Guy (WTG)  * Price: $14.27  For the price you can absolutely do no wrong with this one. The heel part of the shoe can scratch against your ankle which gets annoying but other than that they're great  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Jordan 1 Obsidian**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3055745180&a=b&spm=1101.1101.N.N.bc4a1a6)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/EZEu0FM) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/S9dYMeo)  * Batch: Wood Table Guy (WTG)  * Price: $29.96  TikTok shoe.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike SB Dunk Low Paris**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=2617437910&spider_token=6372)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Zly8JaU) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/oWaCfmp)  * Batch: unknown  * Price: $25.96  Accuracy wise these are awful but I couldn't care less. If anyone is able to ID these shoes on feet they'll know they're reps in an instant as there's no way in hell I'm rocking 60k shoes. The tongue was thin AF so I stuffed it myself. Not aware of any other batches out so if you want a pair of paris dunks you're probably stuck with these.  **Overall: 10/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike SB Dunk Low Tiffany**  **W2C:** [Mr. Hou](https://houyw.x.yupoo.com/)  **Pics:** NO QC PICS | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/Knkvyso)  * Batch: PK  * Price: $62  Overall I got pretty unlucky but I'm not upset about these at all.

The only thing I was able to find which is pretty miniscule at that is the left UN/LA tag is slightly smaller than the right. Otherwise these are amazing and the best batch out and for $100 cheaper than what UABAT sells these for on his site it's impossible to say no.  **Overall: 10/10**  &nbsp;  **Dior B23**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3795854538&spider_token=1be7)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Ir2QydU) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/BcZNNru)  * Batch: Wood Table Guy (WTG)  * Price: $32.51  These are far from good but for a budget batch I was not going to complain. They have the dio flaw which is common amongst budget batches which is the glaring flaw. When I first got these they were uncomfortable as fuck but became decent after 2 wears. If you've looking for a better batch definitely check out LY who have the best rn AFAIK.  **Overall: 8/10**  &nbsp;  **VISVIM slides**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=565477817964)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Cs0zuf2) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/pNZyIad)  * Batch: unknown  * Price: $19.27  These are comfy af and look good as hell. not much else to say  **Overall: 10/10**;;W2C white laces for the Obsidian's?","{upvote:1,timestamp:2020-10-18}",Reddit,0,

These clothes are probably better for older folks who work in an office environment or at some fancy university. I love making these reviews, because it is thanks to this community that I can finally wear great brands without spending all of my hard earned money, therefore I would like to give back something. I hope you will like these items.

Makes you a little bit bigger, wider due to the pattern    and thick material. It's heavy, great for wearing it over a tee during autumn, you won't need a sweater most likely.    Logo is pretty good. For 89 yuan it's a great piece, highly recommended.  \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  2.: Tommy Hilfiger Navy Dress Shirt <<< [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=594942763119) \>>> <<< [In Hand and Agent pictures](https://imgur.com/a/RAVn8av) \>>> Size: M   Again a great shirt, really good quality fabric, logo is great too. Optimal for semi-formal events, not really a jacket    dress shirt because it has buttoms on the collar.  \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  3.: Tommy Hilfiger Black Sweatshirt <<< [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=598350017705) \>>> <<< [In Hand and Agent pictures](https://imgur.com/a/0SgLK2H) \>>> Size: M   Looks and feels retail, really good subtle piece, great to wear on a bottom down shirt.

This is a fantasy item, but people can't tell that easily. The logos are pretty good on it, quality feels decent. For this    price it's an amazing belt. Feels durably too. I ordered 3 of them.   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  8.: Ralph Lauren White Dress Shirt <<< [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=565406170393) \>>> <<< [In Hand and Agent pictures](https://imgur.com/a/Os0DErE) \>>> Size: S   I love this shirt, decent logo, good material.

Lululemon,quality,"Arc'teryx Veilance Isogon MX from Repcourier Picked up an Arc‚Äôteryx Isogon MX jacket from Repcourier. I needed a water resistant jacket with a little warmth for an upcoming trip.  Timeline:  Aug 9 - Sent whatsapp inquiring about the jacket and stock of the dark blue Immediate reply about stock and direct shipping. Required three items for direct ship. Chose two more cheap items.  Jacket, Arc‚Äôteryx baseball cap, and Lululemon gym bag (city explorer) were the items I chose.  Total: $136 USD (jacket was $68)  Aug 11 - Receive payment instructions and pay via PP f&f  Aug 14 - receive a message stating the black Lululemon bag is OOS, and to choose a diff color.  Aug 19 - receive QC/PSP photos, give green light  Aug 22 - inquire about whether items have shipped, receive immediate response with affirmative, and promise of tracking #  Aug 29 - inquire about tracking number, receive immediate response with tracking #  Sept 6 - receive items  Quality: 10/10  Excellent fabric, no loose threads, water resistant (the Isogon MX is not 100% waterproof). Looks exactly like the auth, and from fondling the auth, feels just like it as well. Came with zip garment bag with logo.  Waterproofness: 10/10  The Isogon MX is intended to be water resistant, so I never expected full waterproof, HOWEVER, I wore the jacket in the rain, and tested in for a couple minutes in the shower and I got no water leakthroughs at the seams and no soaking of the fabric. Water beads off the fabric easily and does not collect. Pockets allowed no water inside in the shower.  Fit: 10/10  perfect fit for me, repcourier gave sizing advice and it was perfect.  Accuracy: 9.9/10  Cannot tell the difference between this and the auth, the only thing I see is a slight difference in the collar tag  Update after trip:  Wore the jacket daily on my trip, through wind, some rain, and temperatures between 16-18C (60-65F) and down to about 13C (55F), where I was definitely feeling the cold through the jacket but not uncomfortable. Wearing a sweater underneath and an outside layer was perfect at that temperature. Rain did not soak through the fabric, even after wearing it for 2-3 hours in constant rain. Jacket was highly breathable, no sweat buildup or sticky feeling inside. Packed down small in my luggage.  I had one small issue with the item which was that the hood drawstring came unattached (or wasn't attached in the first place) on one side, so when I went to tighten the hood, it pulled out of the grommet. The hood did not blow off even though I could not tighten it down, and the hood peak kept the rain out of my eyes.  I have sent repcourier a message about the hood drawstring with a picture, and he offered to send me an Arc'Teryx Beta LT at no cost, which I accepted. Excellent post-sales service, definitely buy from repcourier!

Cartier,"price,comparison","Jewelry Review (detailed)- (HLINJEWELRY) Cartier Love bracelet + Ring for WOMEN / GIRLS / GUYS Another post for the girlies! (or guys). Recently I decided to tap more into the jewelry side of this sub, so far I‚Äôve gotten a few Pandora bracelets and charms, moissanite bracelets, and now a few Cartier love bracelets and rings. I usually don‚Äôt do reviews for these items but I think I‚Äôve found the best seller for a really good price! One of my favorite purchases from them is this Titanium Steel Cartier Love Bracelet and ring, all lead-free.  https://preview.redd.it/vvroxk6mtotb1.jpg?width=3503&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d3dfe9e2d78b8e5978acdf30759d8eab95a2245  I‚Äôve gotten the love bracelets before from other sellers but this one definitely exceeded my expectations. They paid close attention to details because these have the most flawless design. It has all the hallmark engravings inside (logo, serial #, etc) and I think titanium steel is the closest we‚Äôll get to white gold and it is the most durable in comparison to other materials used by sellers.  https://preview.redd.it/o8qb6vuototb1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a6eeedb479bf6df3f4e11f595485aceb2dbb48f  The stone is made from zircon and after basically wearing it every day, it remains well secured, It‚Äôs not cheaply made, and both screws to lock it are very sturdy. You can do anything in it without it breaking or getting scratched!  https://preview.redd.it/ofyfo4mqtotb1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ada495047b4c94aea184a53bff958bbf2d72ba1  Mine came with the screwdriver, the original box, the certificate of authenticity, and some gift bags. Everything came up to around $90 USD, shipping included.

H&M,consumerism,"What's the point of buying a bogo rep? What's the point of buying a bogo rep? Let's say you buy a supreme t-shirt, all you are getting is a brand based on exclusivity. if you are already buying reps you presumably think the artificial inflation of these items is stupid, so why not just buy a normal brand instead? I understand that reps are cheaper than the original, but is it not more straightforward to just get a shirt from H&M or another retailer? When you buy rep supremes you are essentially advertising a company that exemplifies consumerism (e.g the brick fiasco). Why would you want a message of consumerism to be so essential to your style?   I know some of you say you want ""to flex"" but often when I see someone wearing supremes they are just a teenager who gets money from their parents. Moreover, its possible to be financially irresponsible and to buy supreme clothing so the brand does not necessarily indicate wealth. It also seems a bit stupid to want to show a form of wealth through a supreme brand. Is this not perpetuating elements of classism?  Why would you want something so superficial to be a part of your style?;;lmao the amount of shit thats going on in the world and your worried about bogo reps.

Nike,"comparison,popular","Nike tech fleece pants comparison Nike tech fleece pants (Comparison)  Nike Tech Fleece Pants Review  Hi guys, seems like the Nike tech fleece pants is popular on this sub. I‚Äôll do a quick comparison with my authentic. Bear in mind mine is used . Maybe 2-3 times . Retail is black , rep is green?   Tech fleece pants wtc : [COP](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=573745184333&spm=1101.1101.N.N.53ea8a3)  [Comparison](https://imgur.com/a/GvepzJE)  My retails are size M . I usually wear a size 34 pants. But I think I‚Äôm a 33?  Reps are size L. Lengths of both pants are similar. The reps offer the same skinny look as the retails.  Here is a short summary: -Retail fits fine, I have to tighten the drawstrings to keep it from falling.  The rep is really tight at the waist area. I recommend to size up twice to get a comfier fit -Outer material and inner material feels similar to touch  -the rep weighs at least 100g-150g lighter than retail -side zip pocket is not as flushed as retails (refer to photo) zip motion feels smooth ish. Similar to retails.  -drawstrings feels similar   Bear in mind, I‚Äôve washed my retails once and rep is brand new.;;I also have both retails and reps. Look pretty much identical but would personally have said the retails are much thicker. Reps prone to pilling after a wash or two, hasn't happened yet at all w/ my retails.","{upvote:7,timestamp:2020-07-16}",Reddit,1,0

"Nike,Adidas,Puma",quality,"Review: EZJerseys Hi all, Recent addition to Reddit and Pandabuy but really found the site and reviews helpful so just thought I‚Äôd take the time to post a review of my experience purchasing from EZJerseys, who I found via the Trusted Sellers list:  https://ezjersey.x.yupoo.com/albums  I actually purchased the jerseys via Pandabuy so don‚Äôt have a link to purchase. But it was actually very easy to purchase via the agent - I just copied the links provided via the yupoo page and pasted them directly into the search bar on the Pandabuy page. The order page then popped up for the jersey and you could then select the size, name and number from the options available, and any additional league patches available (champions league, premier league, la liga etc.)   First thing I would note is that it‚Äôs helpful to know your size in the different makes. For instance, the puma players jerseys are much more slimmer than the adidas and Nike. The Nike player versions are somewhere between the adidas and Puma. So there‚Äôs a bit of trial and error size-wise. But generally you will want to size up from the replica versions to the players versions. So if you are an XL in the replicas, you‚Äôll want an XXL in the player versions. That worked fine with the Adidas jerseys that I purchased. It also worked for the Puma player jersey, but the Haaland Man City player jersey was definitely a slimmer cut than the Messi Miami player in the same size.   I found the buying process to be pretty easy - once I placed the order via Pandabuy, I received a notification from the agent that there were no returns or exchanges on any of the jerseys that I ordered with custom lettering. At first I was wary but then realized this is actually common practice basically just about anywhere that you have a name and number added to a jersey. So I proceeded with the transaction. Here‚Äôs where I think EZJersey could do a bit better with communication, and told him as much so hopefully he/she/them will take my advice: a notification is sent very quickly that your order has been completed and shipped, but the tracking doesn‚Äôt update. This is because the jerseys haven‚Äôt actually shipped yet - it takes a few days to complete all of the customization. So you might get antsy because the agent is saying it shipped but there‚Äôs no tracking info. But the jerseys were actually completed and shipped within 4-5 days of ordering. So just be patient!   Everything else went well during the Pandabuy process.   Regarding quality, I can‚Äôt speak to the retro jerseys that I ordered because I don‚Äôt see authentic versions of old jerseys very often but the quality looked very, very good when compared to other replica/fan versions. For the more current stuff,I see player/on field and fan versions very often and what I received is definitely on par. The quality is very good. Can‚Äôt say if it‚Äôs 1:1 exactly, but it‚Äôs very good quality from the jersey materials to the patches to the names and numbers. On the kids size, I have been able to compare those up close and those are definitely 1:1 if not better, because we rarely see the kids stuff available for sale here with the league patches and matching names and numbers (many of the teams are now providing different font and numbering for domestic leagues, international comps, domestic cups, etc.)   All in all, a good experience and I was very pleased with the quality of the jerseys that I received. Sizing is the biggest unknown but you can get that sorted out after some trial and error.  Hope this helps others as I found posted reviews to be very helpful!  Below are a few links to some of the jerseys that I chose via the yupoo page (you‚Äôll see the weidian link at the top of the page which is the link that I pasted into the Pandabuy search field):  https://ezjersey.x.yupoo.com/albums/140999080?uid=1  https://ezjersey.x.yupoo.com/albums/137533084?uid=1  https://ezjersey.x.yupoo.com/albums/133578096?uid=1  https://ezjersey.x.yupoo.com/albums/137574995?uid=1;;How mutch was the weight?","{upvote:2,timestamp:2023-08-13}",Reddit,0,

Gucci,price,"Vyshyvankas are a universal element of fashion: are they interesting outside of Ukraine and Slavic countries? https://preview.redd.it/tczszgsm84oa1.jpg?width=667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c2485a91698fad8af344e80bc5a0b460d08c3e0  Made in Ukraine and other Slavic countries, the vyshyvanka or embroidered dress has become a symbol of culture and tradition. But is it interesting to wear it to someone else outside of these countries?  We know that each country has its own traditions and rituals, and embroidery is an integral part of this culture. However, today cross-stitch and satin stitch embroidery is used by global brands such as Gucci, Zimmerman and others as a decor item for their clothing line.  Many girls look at pictures or videos from fashion shows and do not understand how laborious this process is and how cool they can look in an embroidered shirt or dress with embroidery! I do not understand why such beauty should be priced at a low cost, although it takes from 2 weeks to 1 month to make one product.  Vyshyvanka is a universal element of fashion that can be interesting and valuable not only in Ukraine and Slavic countries, but also abroad. It not only reflects culture and traditions, but is also a piece of decor that complements the image and gives it individuality.  I look forward to your comments on this...;;It's definitely interesting! I finally just ordered a custom item from [Gusak designs](https://www.instagram.com/gusak_design/?hl=en) after eyeing their dresses for a couple of years.

"LV,Burberry",price,"Just WOW! We don‚Äôt deserve Brother Sam! Through out the years, I‚Äôve purchased from every single T1 seller there is and have spent thousands of dollars during this time. Usually as a buyer you hope for two things from a seller, honesty and a good customer service.  Couple of weeks ago I for the first time heard of a seller called ‚ÄùBrother Sam‚Äù and his website ‚ÄùFashionrepsfam‚Äù, So I thought I‚Äôve been fucked over buy so many other sellers, is he the seller I‚Äôve always looked for? So I ordered a ‚Äùcheap‚Äù LV Wallet just to test him and his website out.  I was so surprised, that was the best experience I‚Äôve ever had. I created a account, ordered, my QC came, I inspected my QC and pressed a green button called ‚ÄùGL‚Äù and it was that simple! Very simple and straightforward experience. The wallet itself was amazing aswell, I own multiple retail LV items and his canvas was really T1, Old Cobbler level at a cheaper price!  Couple of days ago I ordered 3 more items, 2 LV items and a Burberry Backpack for ~270 euros as a gift to my brother in-law and it turns out my fiancee got him a backpack as well... So I thought I just burned 270 euros, I guess I can use it myself. But just to see how great of a seller Brother Sam is, I asked him if I could get the backpack refunded. Tbh I wasnt expecting any good answer, I was expecting more of a ‚ÄùAlready ordered, sorry‚Äù. Usually when you purchase something from a T1 seller it is REALLY hard to get your money back, near impossible.  12 hours passed, I got a message from Brother Sam saying ‚ÄùOk, refunded bro‚Äù, I was shocked? Never have I through out my years of being a 1:1 succ guru, experienced this amazing customer service. I usually don‚Äôt recommend any sellers and always hesitate when buying from a T1 seller, but Brother Sam and his website is a seller I strongly can recommend.  For crying out loud, OC has started to take 10$ ‚ÄùDonation for their hard work‚Äù if you want QC.;;God this seems like such thinly veiled ad","{upvote:28,timestamp:2019-07-23}",Reddit,1,0

YSL,quality,La Califfa Trucker Jackets YSL & Tom Ford - Best Purchase Hey guys! I bought two amazing Hand Made Suede jackets from La Califfa after seeing some here on this subreddit.   Tl;dr: The jackets are so amazing I am blown away. Can only recommend them!   Ordering process: Reached out to them on Whatsapp and got a quick response. Told them which jackets I like and sadly the suede base material of the first color I wanted wasnt available. The seller presented me some more real-life pictures with other options. Went with the Yellowish Camel Brown Jacket and the Black one. There are size charts on the website and I kinda rushed it and told the seller my height and weight and already the size I thought i d needed. The seller said I d need a custom size. In the end I measured a similar shirt and the seller was right. I am glad he didnt jump the gun like me. Paid via Superbuy as my agent and received the goods very quickly even though I ordered right before chinese new year.  Quality etc: I am no expert but the jackets feel amazing. The material is very thick compared to a branded suede jacket I bought locally and the Buttons and Stitches are just great. No loose threads or anything and the button holes are kinda enforced so they dont open up over the time of use. The seller provided me the option to remove their own branding/tags but I really like the name (old italian movie - La Califfa/Lady Caliph) so wanted them on there. The packaging it came with was also great. It came with a very thick hanger for jackets and a dust bag in a nicely made box. The black one looks kinda greyish on the pictures but in real life it is the blackest black I have seen in clothes. The colors look overall more saturated in real.

"Chanel,Versace",quality,"I ordered 3 bottles of Cologne from the Perfume Guy (100$+) This post probably won't be the most detailed but thought I would leave a review to help other people decide if they want to order from him.   General:  I ordered on December 7th from the West Coast US and received my order on the 26th which was pretty expected. The package was way smaller than I expected but I did order plastic bottles and I assume they are smaller than the glass bottles. Once opened the package was very slimy and oily with bubble wrap surrounding the cologne, so I assume the person who packed my order had cologne oil all over their hands or something leaked. Overall the bottles were decent and sprayed as the average cologne bottle would.  So my order consisted of:  Bleu De Chanel 1.2oz I believe  Creed Aventus 2oz  Eros Versace Flame 2oz  The Bleu De Chanel was a 1:2 consistency and smelt great but was extremely strong when first putting it on but after around 1 hour it smelt great.  Creed Aventus was very odd since I heard extreme hype over it in the cologne world but smelt very off to me, I regret ordering it in a 1:2 consistency as this is way too strong and overpowering but the cologne itself isn't great. Very off-putting that people spend 300$ on the real version of this (3.4 ounce bottle) but maybe something was just off with my order  Eros Versace Flame was 1:2 consistency like my whole order and just doesn't smell that good, I am not trained at finding the scent a cologne puts off but if I had to compare it, it smells a lot like Polo Red but more cinnamony if that makes any sense.   I would give the perfume guy a 7.5/10 on the order and I probably messed it up by ordering in such a high concentration rate but the cologne smelt like good quality stuff.

"Nike,LV,Gucci,Zara,H&M,Calvin Klein","quality,price,haul","Replica Clothing Ruined Shopping for me A little back story to this post, I recently went on vacation in London and was excited to buy new clothes for my closet, I set out for one specific item, a pair of solid cargo pants; simple in concept but incredibly difficult to get a nice pair (I enjoy shopping more than the average Joe). I went to over 50 shops and genuinely could not find one pair of brown cargos that I could see myself rocking. I searched and searched: Zara, Bershka, Nike, Superdry, H&M, etc.; eventually I found a pair that I like just enough to justify the price asked. Just a couple hours later I loaded up  r/fashionreps and found an even nicer pair of Nike cargos; mind you the ones I bought are not even branded, and I spent almost 4 times the price compared to these ones.   Am I upset I spent much more? not at all, what it did to me however was realize how unrewarding purchasing ‚Äúreal‚Äù clothes is.   After this purchase I made it my mission to check the quality of designer and fashionable products and I was so taken aback. I found multiple Bape shirts going for almost 200¬£ and all had multiple stitching errors and loose strings. If someone is to spend unreasonable amounts of their wage on shirts or shoes or scarfs you‚Äôd think the quality would be perfect or the next best thing, but this is not the case. LV belts with loose buckles, Gucci wallets with awkward alignment, and St√ºssy shirts with crumbling print, almost half of what I saw had some flaw, mostly minor with a couple of extreme cases. Knowing that these high quality clothes were the same quality as budget batch replica‚Äôs,  what makes the price asked in stores justified?   Is it the branding? The convenience? The status ‚Äúearned‚Äù from handing your card over to the cashier in exchange for a nice item? Maybe the fact that the store has to pay utilities so they upscale everything?  You get crucified by ‚ÄúHype-Beasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúFashion-Gurus‚Äù when you ask about fakes but comparing the same pieces often is indistinguishable to almost everyone you‚Äôll meet. When you own replica clothes and just post fit pics not a soul will call it out, and if they do you can just delete the comment. In person it‚Äôs even more unlikely to get called out, people are lazy and often avoid unnecessary issues. Buying anything makes me think immediately of how much cheaper it would be to have it sent straight to the warehouse and has essentially put me off anything not directly from a manufacturer.  Calvin Klein underwear for 9‚Ç¨, you save 30. Chrome hearts sterling silver ring for 40‚Ç¨, you save a couple grand, supreme shirt for 15‚Ç¨, you save 80. You can buy beautiful jackets and shoes only Millionaires can afford and feel incredible about yourself without not being able to pay rent or afford food. It‚Äôs a confidence booster no matter which way you look at it, and a perk of the low prices is simply being able to experiment and choose different fits that would never be readily accessible with the ‚Äúreal deal‚Äù.  Every single item is like this, from the manufacturer it‚Äôs almost half or more ‚Äúoff‚Äù; and the budget batches save up to 90%. People say you get what you pay for and low price is low quality but hundreds of posts, videos, and reviews later it‚Äôs safe to say replicates hold their own much more than people outside this subreddit understand. It‚Äôs a cotton shirt vs a cotton shirt, not a cotton shirt vs a paper shirt. People understand reps as the Turkish Bazaar Reps where they make your skin yellow or the China town street vendors that charge eye watering prices for shoes with a lifespan of 2 weeks. It‚Äôs understandable that there is a stigma behind this niche of fashion but over the next few years we can expect a blow out in the fashion realm because with some extra cash, most items simply are 1:1; and people are always looking for a good deal.  I‚Äôd love to hear from y‚Äôall and maybe we can share some other experiences regarding how reps changed shopping. I‚Äôm still new to reps and have multiple hauls ready to be shipped out, but otherwise it seems like this is a common trend with most buyers.;;I feel you bro, never came back to authentic shopping ever since i discovered reps.

"Gucci,Dior","fast fashion,quality,price","Reps are soo much better than genuine A genuine question for all out there who have copped reps and the real deal. But do you think reps are of a better higher quality than the genuine items?  For context, I worked at footlocker during my uni days and now that I have a professional job I still until recently copped the genuine items. BUT Jordan brand for examples quality is soo trash I‚Äôm surprised majority of their shoes hit the retailers and pass QC.  AND I‚Äôve bought genuine designers items in the past like Saint Laurent Paris, Gucci (trash quality why do people go crazy for this stuff??) and Dior. And if I‚Äôm being honest the quality of these designer items is soo trash for the price you pay. I‚Äôve had fast fashion items last and age better. I used to buy alot of SLP jeans but my Carhartt jeans and Levi jeans have aged soooo much better as better quality!  Anyone else feel the same way or have similar experiences?;;case by case. depends on brand.   Prada, Balanciaga, Dior etc -> many of their stuff are grossly overpriced at garbage quality. esp Prada - many of their Nylon jackets retail at $3k+. which is absolute insanity.   Balanciaga stuff is not only low quality, but fugly as hell. I wouldnt wear 90% of their stuff even given for free.

Chanel,,"not the usual ParfumeGuy review Hello, probably a lot of people many people will disagree what im going to say.  ABOUT THE SELLER /u/peracar00  He replies very fast and is very friendly and helpful. The parfume were very good packed. I was only disappointed about the delivery time because i waited for more then a month thinking that the parcel was lost. He help me shipping again. The day after he shipped the tracking of the parcel start working again so now i 2 parfume :)   Now i will talk about the parfume: I will be brief... if you want to buy an exact scent this is not the right place. The smells are very good and in some case similar to the original ones. For exaple i bought Blue de chanel to campare the original i own and yes, you can smell the acidulous partof the scent but apart this the smell is completly different.  Also scents have a very very strong alcohol odor that kills pretty much all the top notes.  In conclusion if you want to buy a cheap parfume this is the way but this will not give you the fantastic vibe of the original one.  sorry for the bad english;;So as of recent I've actually gotten into making different perfumes. One of the complications I've run into is, you get the scent correct to the original when you compare it to the oil concentrate, but then when you mix in the alcohol, it completely changes the way it smells in the drydown. Still trying to figure out the best way to combat the issue. I've got the ratios correct, but can't seem to maintain that beautiful auroma that the concentrate has to offer. More time to experiment I guess.","{upvote:1,timestamp:2020-02-07}",Reddit,0,

"Hermes,Chanel",,"Chez Pierre perfume review (Sauvage, Tom Ford, Spicebomb, bleu de chanel and more.) This is my first time buying from Chez Pierre and I am really satisfied. I have been in the perfume game for almost a year, so I have a good nose for perfume and how they smell, etc. I bought 5 x 20 mL (samples) + 55 mL + 40 mL. All 1:3 ratio.  the 5 samples:  \- 2 times spice bomb - in space: I give this a 10/10, this smell is amazing. I know the smell of the original and it is exactly like the original one and is really sweet and spicy like the original. If you like spices like cinnamon this is the perfect one for you.1:3 ratio is strong enough and I would not recommend going for stronger.  \- Terres d'Hermes - hero: I would give this a solid 10/10, it smells almost exactly the same and really strong and woody. from this one, I also know the original and it is almost exactly the same, it only has a tiny bit of difference. 1:3 ratio is perfect, not too strong, and not soft.  \- Sauvage - wild bergamot: this one I would give an 8.5/10, this one a lot fresher than the original Sauvage. In the beginning, I thought it was a bit too fresh because I missed the spiciness like the original one, but after 20-30 minutes, it smelled a lot spicier sharp. And it is not as spicy and sharp as the original one but in a way, I like it because you can really smell the bergamot. would recommend this one if you want to smell fresh and not too strong.  \- TF ombre leather - existation: I would give this a 6.5/10, in the beginning, it smells delicious actually. In the beginning, it smells like jasmine with a soft twist of leather. but after it really sits on your skin it smells really strong like leather, as if you were in a leather shop. after that, I can not notice the fresh jasmine anymore. I would actually recommend this if you like to smell like strong leather otherwise not. only from this one, I did not know the smell of the original one.   These were the samples.  \- Bleu de Chanel - bleu chance 55 mL Limited Edition glass bottle: I would give this a 7.5/10. I ordered this perfume as a gift for my father because the original one smells really strong and woody. but when I tested it does not smell the same at all, so I was a bit disappointed because I liked the smell of the original. it is far fresher than the original one, and you really miss the strong wood smell. but in a way I like it, it smells like a douche gel I own but as a perfume and a bit stronger. I would recommend this as a casual perfume if you want to smell fresh and casual, nothing special. If you do not like very a strong smell you should go for the 1:4 because now 1:3 is already strong enough I think.  \- La vie est belle - ma vie 40 mL plastic bottle: I would give this a solid 10/10, I got this as a gift for my sister and she has the original one and she says it smells exactly the same. I found the smell really nice, but I would recommend going for a ratio of 1:4 because 1:3 can be a bit too strong for some people.  the communication was really good, and I would really recommend his perfumes. also, the perfumes were tied and wrapped up really well. thank you u/peracar00 for your perfumes, you have a new customer!

Prada,"quality,worth it,comparison","[REP vs. Retail] Prada Glasses W2C : https://detail.1688.com/offer/693465418492.html  Hello, today I want to show you the comparison between an original Prada glasses and a replica version. The white one is the original, while the black one is the replica. The shape is slightly different of the frontview of the two glasses as you can see at the pictures. The original fits a little tighter on your head. It's evident from the start that the original glasses are slightly heavier. The hinges on both glasses are approximately the same, though it can be said that the hinge of the original glasses is naturally a bit better. All in all, the original Prada glasses are definitely of higher quality. However, when considering purchasing the original for nearly ‚Ç¨300, one must weigh whether it's worth it, as the replica version for just two euros is surprisingly good, as can be seen in the pictures. If you have any questions feel free to ask in the comments. I hope i can help with this comparison between rep and retail ü´°","{upvote:9,upvoteRatio:0.92,timestamp:2023-12-16}",Reddit,0,
"LV,Gucci","quality,price,comparison","[REVIEW] Koala's Gucci Ace (Comparison with Naisan & Retail) Three weeks ago I decided to GP this pair of Gucci Ace Bee's from Koala. To be honest, I expected a normal pair (I mean, good one, but not 1:1 at all - similar to Naisan). I compared this with my friends Gucci Ace Tiger from Naisan, and with a friends retail Gucci Ace Bees (Those are size 46 tho)   MAIN POINT OF THE COMPARISON: I wanted to wear my shoes in hard conditions and daily for as much time as possible in order to be able to make a FAIR review and comparison. My friends Tiger Ace from Naisan had some wear and the other friends Ace Bees have also some wear so it wouldn't be fair to compare a brand new pair to those.   So, I used my pair DAILY for two weeks. It's been through 2 rainy days, walked around for approximately 2/3 hours a day, driven for 1 hour a day more or less (automatic, no need to clutch, this is important for the toebox). So- they have been through some intense wear, yeah.  Now, onto the review and comparison with retail and Naisan's batch. (Note: Naisan's batch was purchased two months ago. It's been worn max twice a week.  Retail's were bought 1 month ago, second hand from a close friend of the new owner with really few wears. He has used them for around 3 times a week since then, in light conditions, and for driving. Hasn't walked much in them)   This shoes are god damn amazing. I didn't expect them to be this good or even close. First impression was great. Well packed, included even an invoice (please if you buy don't be a dick and resell them. The invoice is from Australia tho so won't work for most of the scammers) and all those things nobody really uses or cares about but are nice to have. Box arrived perfect also. First thing I noticed before opening was the RFID on the tag. Nice touch.  Now, I just got the shoes out of the box and packaging and I fell in love. Tbh I expected them to be uncomfortable at first until I broke them in, but they were super comfy. I think this happens for every retail and Naisan's batch also.     [PICTURES OF KOALA's BATCH](https://imgur.com/a/kpcxNcC)  I'll try to take pictures of Naisan's batch and retails as soon as I can see both of my friends.   Overall, I cannot comment much on flaws as I'm not as picky as much people. I can compare the 3 shoes I have access too with the wear they have. I'm not reviewing any of them brand new, but they're not beat up. They have some NORMAL wear. Not too worn.   Side by side with my friends retail, the bee looks almost the same. I can't speak about Naisan cause that's Tiger, and not bee. Material feels the same (all this after the two weeks of intense wear) as my friends retail. Naisan has a different feel, not far from these two, he definitely has real and great quality leather, but it's not the same feel.    The snake skin in the back. This is the only slight difference I could really feel a bit with the retails. The change between scales is a bit 'softer' on my pair than on his. By viewing it, it looks exactly the same, but when you touch you can feel a slight difference with his. I think this might be influenced by his having more wear and the scales being more wrinkled than mine. Naisan's batch has the biggest difference here. I don't know if it's because of bad wear, or what, but the snake skin on the lower part of Naisan's batch is starting to loose feel, color, I don't know how to explain it well, I'll try to take pictures as soon as I can to show. The top part is also worse, scales difference can't be felt, but the lower is just getting completely messed up. I doubt retail will evolve like this. https://imgur.com/a/nZ43m5G Naisan's batch   Shape to me looks pretty similar on all three shoes. Toebox on Naisan looks a bit more squared, less rounded, but this is practically unnoticeable. Shape is holding up great on my pair and really few wear marks have appeared for the use I've given the shoes. However this will be more noticeable in time like all leather shoes.  Laces! I can't make a honest comparison about them since Naisan's batch were washed twice and they have a much worse feeling than the other two laces (Retail and Koala), probably influenced cause of that. The feel is super soft on Koala's laces and same with retail. I hope someone with Naisan's batch can give a bit more of insight with this.    I've heard Ioli's batch is really good but don't know anyone who owns one to compare, however after all those McQueen quality issues, I don't feel I will try him anytime soon lol.  CONCLUSION:  After comparing the two batches with retail, I cannot speak on who makes the most accurate 'figures' as Naisan's other animal. However bee looks superb on Koala's batch. Naisan's batch is definitely one of the best out there and has been for long, but I think Koala has brought us a closer and more accurate batch of Gucci Ace's. Both have a really similar price, but Koala is just $5 more expensive in the end (more or less, depending on payment method and all that). All in all, both are great batches, but after feeling both, I'd stay with Koala for those extra $5   Naisan's contact information:  WeChat: Naisan23 [Yupoo](http://naisan23.x.yupoo.com/albums)   Koala's contact information: Wechat: DC66169 [Yupoo](http://2335499519.x.yupoo.com/albums?tab=gallery) [Taobao (LINK FOR MEN SHOES)](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=598622233164);;(im kinda new).

W2C: reondistrict.com  Pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/Henht0w](https://imgur.com/a/Henht0w)  &#x200B;  After hearing a lot of hype about Reon and korean sellers, I decided to take the leap and sample one of their t-shirts. I had the chance to compare it to the retail version so here is an honest review. Note- the scores are based on how close it is to retail.  Cost: I only bought the 1 t-shirt and with shipping it came to **$62** (expensive I know but I wanted to see what the hype was about).  **Material: 7/10**. The material of the Reon tee is *very thin*. The retail is thin itself but you can see skin through the Reon tee. I've tried my best to get this across in the pictures but it is more noticeable in person. I'm sure that you won't get called out on this and that it is good quality, but very thin.  **Fitting: 9/10**. I bought a size Small and it is *very* big/baggy. I'm not a fan of this fit, but I gave it a 9/10 because it's pretty much the same fitting as retail.   **Accuracy/print quality: 7/10**. The text is in the right place. The font is smaller than on the retail but you won't get called out on this unless you're right next to someone wearing retail. The biggest difference from the retail is the quality of the print. The retail has a very nice silky/rubbery print that is very smooth when you run your fingers across it. The Reon version has a matte/grainier print which feels/looks cheaper. Again I've tried my best to get this across in the pictures but it was difficult to capture.  **Overall: 7.5/10**  All-in-all I feel that this is a decent t-shirt but to be completely honest I was a bit underwhelmed. You may think I'm being a bit harsh but bear in mind that this t-shirt cost $62 and everyone hypes about it being as close as possible to 1:1 etc. I have posted another side-by-side review on r/DesignerReps with a UKPark t-shirt which you guys should check out. I honestly think that the UKPark t-shirt (which cost 165 yuan) is a similar quality to Reon's t-shirt but at a fraction of the price.;;its 2020 and people are still buying from reon, we just cant stop people enjoy wasting money on overpriced shit rep","{upvote:4,timestamp:2020-03-07}",Reddit,1,0

I might just bleach the eye white, or paint it, or just say fuck it and leave it that way, idk.  &#x200B;  # OnlyFans Tee  [ Size: S - Length: 64 cm | Width: 53 cm | Shoulder: 48 cm ](https://i.redd.it/yo5r581nhye91.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=673467349422) | Weight: 256g | Ôø•72 / $11  Rating: 10/10  Top 5 purchase for sure.

Sleeves are slightly too big for my liking, but that's easily fixed. Also wish it was cropped by an extra inch or two. Think the tags and placement are off and there's a better batch for 300 yuan but I don't even care. I drive a beat up Honda Civic, and anyone who knows me irl knows I'd never drop 1k on a piece of fabric, so the cat was already out of the bag. wEaR wItH cOnFiDeNcE **üëåüèæüò´** ‚Ñ¢ **.**  &#x200B;  # Rhude Desert Print Shirt  [ Size: S - Length: 72 cm \(front\) 78 cm \(back\) | Width: 62 cm | Shoulder: 50 cm ](https://i.redd.it/tawkvtrthye91.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=646288643063) | Weight: 178g | Ôø•178 / $27  Rating: 8/10  Looked at some photos and this shirt is definitely more vibrant than the retail shirt, but I don't mind. Maybe I can fade it in the sun. It's also a little too long for my taste, might have to shorten it. Tried to shrink it in the dryer but it didn't budge.  &#x200B;  # Late Registration Tee  [ Size: S - Length: 68 cm | Width: 54 cm | Shoulder: 46 cm ](https://i.redd.it/ravo3lkvhye91.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=626728545338) | Weight: 218g | Ôø•105 / $16  Rating: 9/10  FashionReps staple, don't need to say too much, no complaints here.  &#x200B;  # 5amrosa Frank Ocean Tee  [ Size: S - Length: 72 cm | Width: 58 cm | Shoulder: 57 cm ](https://preview.redd.it/yrnqs6jzhye91.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6dd247f622023a11b0eaae027da6e97c1b8eef9)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=643522964732) | Weight: 250g | Ôø•68 / $10  Rating: 8/10  Orange and green are one of my favorite color combinations.

Wish the print was a pocket sized logo but I'm ok with it. Rep of an air compressor company from the 1920s.

Buttonhole came sewn shut which took less than a minute to fix with an x-acto knife, but something to be aware of.

I'm actually wearing the red one as I'm writing this.

Getting the bullets through the belt loops on pants makes this slightly annoying to put on. would pair this with the Rhude shirt for that cowboy gunslinger vibe.  # ALYX Belt  [ Length: 112 cm ](https://i.redd.it/n42p547liye91.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=627105990644) | Weight: 173g | Ôø•59 / $9  Rating: 10/10  Doesn't have the ALYX branding on it but the buckle is solid.  &#x200B;  # iPhone 13 Case  https://i.redd.it/pgjyzukmiye91.gif  [W2C](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=666182526946) | Weight: 38g | Ôø•15/ $2  Rating: 10/10  Link died, but I found another for 10 yuan. Pattern is 3D, feels nice to touch, and has a metallic satin finish. Color is a little girlier than I'd like but it complements the blue on my phone so I'm cool with it.  &#x200B;  # Margiela Twisted Number Ring  [ Size: 8](https://i.redd.it/vw8ho76oiye91.gif)  [Inspection Photos](https://imgur.com/a/mYG4RRf) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=650968094213) | Weight: 72g | Ôø•69 / $11  Rating: 8/10  Cool looking ring, not exactly retail accurate but I like it.  &#x200B;  # Star Ring  https://preview.redd.it/c5yklmzpiye91.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cfbfcfa2280b18bcd9e6dd79192dd589caa63a32  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=630707755487) | Weight: 80g | Ôø•98 / $16  Rating: 9/10  Doubt this is actually sterling silver like it says but it's cool looking.

Honestly my fault for not measuring the necklaces I already have out of sheer laziness. I'll just add some jewelry extenders to my next haul so I can get some wear out of these. 45 cm necklace.  &#x200B;  # Dice Bracelet  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/QoQ6d8u) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=644114269446) | Weight: 75g | Ôø•25 / $4  Rating: 7/10  Needed a bracelet and picked the first one I liked off this Taobao store.

Disappointed in the quality of this shoe for the price ngl. The toe box leather is pretty thin, glad I bought crease protectors because these need them. I took out the orange overlaces to see what it'd look like with white laces, and one of the black bands that keep them in place don't stretch far enough to put the overlaces back in. Might rock em without the overlaces or replace the black bands.  &#x200B;  # H12 Pure Money Jordan 4s  Size: EU 43 / US 9.5  [Images](https://imgur.com/a/4E8KZUR) | [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4349837911) | Weight: 1559g | Ôø•360 / $58  Rating: 9/10  Love these, bought them to do a custom, but I think I'll leave them all white for now.

I was sure that I overpaid when I bought this but I really wanted to add a summer top that wasn't another t-shirt to the haul. Sleeves were super boxy on me so I took them in a bit on the sewing machine. Sewed on the wrong side of the shirt by accident but before I ripped the seam out, I flipped it inside out to see what it looked like and I kinda like the way it looks inside out more so I did the same to the other sleeve.

Something to wear on the colder days this summer or at night. It's also cropped fyi.  &#x200B;  # Post Archive Faction PAF 4.0+ Technical Center Pants  Size: S - Length 111 cm | Waist Circumference: 80 cm | Inseam: 84 cm | Rise: 31 cm | Leg Opening 22 cm  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/dQSFnao) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=672264789806) | Weight: 476g | Ôø•297 / $48  Rating: 9/10  Damn, didn't know I spent this much on these. Love em but they're fucking huge on me. Took the waist in on the sewing machine but it's still big and a little too long. Pause. Still gonna wear it for a baggy look with some forces. The breeze in these pants feel nice; in case you can't tell there are holes sewn into the pants where some of the panels connect.  &#x200B;  # CWHAT Vuja De Brown Carpenter Flare Pants  Size: M - Length 98 cm | Waist Circumference: 78 cm | Inseam: 73 cm | Rise: 26 cm | Leg Opening 20 cm  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/9YD2OOR) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=634838455990) | Weight: 691g | Ôø•155 / $25  Rating: 10/10  My favorite pants in this haul without a doubt. The texture is almost suede-like, which isn't what you'd expect on a pair of carpenter pants, but it feels nice, and I like the fit, so I'll let it slide. The adjustment latches/buckles on the side are a nice touch too.  &#x200B;  # Linen Pants  Size: M - Length 93 cm | Waist Circumference: 66 cm | Inseam: 63 cm | Rise: 33 cm | Leg Opening 21 cm  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/LRk6woD) | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=670377471950) | Weight: 328g | Ôø•79 / $13  Rating: 8/10  Needed a pair of linen pants for an upcoming trip so threw these in there. Legs fit slightly too wide for my liking, so I'll have to take them in a bit on the sewing machine.  &#x200B;  Thanks for reading this far, if you need any more measurements or pictures hit me in the comments.

Quality is not amazing but also not that bad. Nike logo is way off but i think everybody knows this. The biggest problem is that sleeves lentgh does not match with chest circumference and lentgh of the whole crewneck.

I didn‚Äôt see any major flaws and in fact it‚Äôs the best version of this bag out here. Now I might get flamed for this but I actually think my friend‚Äôs Lufan bag is better than the UCUT one I ordered before.

Further more I noticed some ppl requested seller to deploy UV400 protection testing with the equipment that only costs $27, which is half price of a rep wallet and the professional equipment  will cost around $11940...lmao.....  I wouldn't say any further cuz we are all sellers. Put myself in your shoes I strongly recommend you to do the UV 400 protection testing in your local optical store and normally that will be free of charge, one of fam copped a Prada shades from me and did that test in his local optical store and the result is 100% uv400 protective and with polarized. Wearing a bare lens with no UV 400 protection is not as bad as getting called out of a rep wallet,  you guys are white ppl (I would say mostly) and your pupil is much less  resistant to UV  than Asian or African ppl, that is why even Asian baby can safely play around under blatant sunshine without any protection. In a word don't ask any seller to do that meaningless UV 400 testing for you, I confirmed with the taobao seller of this $27 UV400 testing equipment and his answer is "" it's mostly a toy, don't take it for real.....""  here is the screenshot from taobao  [https://imgur.com/a/5O1AVzz](https://imgur.com/a/5O1AVzz)  &#x200B;  The intention of this post is not to screw anyone, just want to reveal the truth to you guys and this is Sam always be!","{upvote:363,upvoteRatio:0.93,timestamp:2019-05-06}",Reddit,0,

"Nike,LV,Hermes,Gucci,Uniqlo,Ralph Lauren","quality,price,haul,aesthetic","First ever 8kg haul to Canada - CDG, RL, Yeezy, Nike, Travis Scott This is my first time ever order so I might have gone a bit ham. I can't really comment on how close to retail most of these are but I'll comment on the fit and finish and give an overall rating based on how happy I am with them. # Agent: Pandabuy I'm pretty happy with using Pandabuy. I had some hiccups in the ordering process which were quickly handled. I bought the wrong sizes for the Yeezy slides for my sister's friend and the exchange process was pretty straight forward. Additionally, one of the items I ordered was taking a really long time to come and they cancelled it no questions asked. They also notify you if a seller doesn't offer after-sales service before you confirm purchase which was a really nice disclaimer. Will definitely be using them in the future. The only complaint I have is that it couldn't find the links for many 1688 links but that's not my biggest concern at the moment.  #Parcel - Shipping: Canada PD Line-B to Vancouver - Time: 13 days - Weight: 8 kg - Declared: 14 USD (total) - Cost: 165.90 USD - Insurance: 16.49 USD - Added services: moisture bag and corner protection  [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/KHTdQ2k)  Overall pretty happy with the time and condition. I thought it was taking a bit of time clearing customs which had me stressing but I think it was mostly cause of the long weekend.   [Junior inspector was thorough with his inspection. Senior inspector was thoroughly uninterested.](https://imgur.com/a/hKZPpMo)  #Stats - Height: 5'10 - Weight: 200lb - Shoe size: 9 - Shirt size: L/XL - Pant size: 32W/30L  #Items ##Shoes ###Nike Dunks Panda VT batch - 5/5 $28.36 | [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4968759438&spider_token=4572) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/PQxYpPF)  The leather feels really good and smooth and I don't notice any blemishes. Though I haven't felt the M batch in hand, I don't see a reason to spend extra for this specific CW. Go TTS.  ###Nike AJ1 High Travis Scott FK batch - 4.5/5 $61.19 | [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=5898001095&spider_token=4572) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/YBcJVJ3)  The suede and leather on these feels really good. I love the details that differentiate it from the regular AJ1 including the reverse swoosh, emblem on the back, and cactus jack on the side. If you look very closely the edges of the panels do look a bit rough but it's hardly noticeable unless you're looking at it through a microscope. My biggest complaint with these is that the different laces are different sizes. I wanted to rock one black one pink but it looks odd cause the pink's significantly shorter and doesn't make it to the last eyelet. Go TTS.  ###Yeezy Slides LW batch - N/A $14.93 | [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4406017001&spider_token=4572) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/B3M8pkD)  Didn't want to rate these because I ordered the wrong sizes. I ordered Flax in size 11 for myself and Onyx and Pure for my sister's friend in size 8 since the page said order two sizes up. These are way too big. I think I will order them again and go TTS cause the size 8 pair fits better on me though it is a bit tight. I would suggest anyone else to go TTS. Otherwise, visually, they look great. The plastic is pretty soft. They add a couple inches to my height which I wasn't expecting from slides. Go TTS.  ###Nike AF1 - 5/5 $23.88 | [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4886458512&spider_token=4572) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/iZu7Y5n)  These are for my sister. Not sure what batch they are. Her comments: > 5 ig   > nothinh wrong with them  Go TTS.  ###Nike Dunks VT batch - 5/5 $28.36 | [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4886458512&spider_token=4572) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/40g4fOt)  These are for my sister as well. I don't know if this is a special collab or what the CW is but she liked them. The box says Summit White/Phantom-Cinnabar but a google search didn't give me anything. Same comments as before. Go TTS.  ##Bottoms ###KUYIOU Lifetime pleats pants (Issey Miyake dupe) - 4.75/5 $29.55 | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=613284734010) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/uzMwad0)  No complaints from me on this. The pleats look really good and it fits well on me. Some details I didn't notice in the QC photos are that it has belt loops as well as a button fly with a single button. Not sure what that button is going to do but it's there ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The elastic sometimes twists itself inside the waist which I found a bit strange but it can be easily remedied by just twisting it back.  I went with size M and when wearing it right at the waist it breaks right after the ankle. I wouldn't wear it any lower but if you wear it a bit higher it'll definitely have a cropped look.  ##Tops ###KUYIOU Lifetime pleats polo - 3/5 $32.69 | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=613035029302) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/kQXVjSK)  I would definitely rate this higher if the price wasn't so high. Overall, I like the look of the shirt but considering the price there are some issues with the pleats in the back (see last image) which I can't overlook. I It's a shame cause I really love the overall aesthetic of the shirt otherwise. Looking back at the QC photos the blemishes are there so it's partly my fault for not noticing it. I'd still recommend this shirt just take a good look at your QC photos.  I got a size M which has a regular fit. If you like a bit more oversized size up.  ###CDG Play cardigan from [Repsbrothers](https://repsbrothers.x.yupoo.com/albums) - 5/5 $55.22 | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=693030481300) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/1dixODs)  This is probably my favourite item from this haul. I've wanted this cardigan since high school. The stitching is really high quality and the buttons have a subtle pearlescent shine which looks great. I got a size XL and it's got a regular fit. Definitely size one up for a regular fit or two up for a baggy fit with these.  ###CDG Play striped long sleeve from [Repsbrothers](https://repsbrothers.x.yupoo.com/albums) - 4.9/5 $25.37 | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=693555663273) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/fPovqUO)  The only issue I have with this is that the arms are a bit short but I do have proportionally longer arms but it's very minor. Same deal as the cardigan in terms of sizing.  NOTE about Repsbrothers: I tried to buy the half heart T-shirt from them and it ended up being OOS after I purchased. They automatically refunded me without having to say anything which I was really happy with. ~~They don't offer after sales service otherwise so take that as you will.~~ /u/Repsbrothers just responded and said they do offer after sales service. This might have been a weird automated message or something from Pandabuy.  ###Ralph Lauren corduroy bear button down from [Husky](https://husky-reps.x.yupoo.com/) - 4/5 $20.60 | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=702570647674) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/WlCkzS4)  I'd say for the price, this is a bit much. I expected this to be thicker (like the [Uniqlo corduroy work shirt](https://www.uniqlo.com/ca/en/products/E450266-000?colorCode=COL35&sizeCode=SMA003)). Other than that, it's pretty nice. I got a size L and I wish I had sized up for a more oversized look.  NOTE on Husky: I'm pretty disappointed with the shipping times. It took over a week for all my items to come and I didn't get any updates while I waited. The items were stuck on the purchased stage (not even seller sent) and then just appeared at the warehouse. I ordered another item from him that had no updates for over 2 weeks and I ended up just cancelling it. I understand there may be shipping delays but I expect updates regarding them.  ##Accessories ###Ralph Lauren teddy bear beanie from [Husky](https://husky-reps.x.yupoo.com/) - 3.5/5 $11.34 | [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=684517642773) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/BdeyoJn)  I thought it would be smaller like a fisherman's beanie. It does fit nice and snug and is quite warm. I really like the embroidered bear :). Low rating is mostly cause I feel like this could be cheaper to be honest. Additionally this took like 1.5 weeks to get to the warehouse.  ###Ferragamo belt - 5/5 $33.58 | [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4671968267&spider_token=4572) | [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/xF8CEXn)  This is probably tied as my favourite item from this haul. I like that the buckle is a bit more subtle and not as in your face compared to other designer belts. Love that it's reversible. The leather has a tumbled look and has a very soft feel; it's not super rigid. Oddly enough, it comes with a receipt from Hong Kong?? It also comes with a cloth bag and a [leather hole punch](https://leathersmithdesigns.com/product_images/uploaded_images/craftool-round-drive-punch-size-1.jpg).  The sizing on the page is kinda weird ngl. It's not a big issue cause you can cut it yourself since the buckle is removable. I just went at it with kitchen shears. I got the 105 ohm cause I measured my waist with a tape measure and that's what it suggested. I'd definitely go for a smaller size next time cause I had to hack off like a solid 5-7 cm.  I will definitely consider them in the future if I want another designer belt since they have lots of other options including Gucci, LV, Hermes, etc.  #Closing remarks I know this review's kinda long but I wanted to be thorough for others. Also for any other nervous first timers, I'd say go for it and make sure to read the damn guide. It's very thorough and answers almost any question you can possibly have. If after that you still have questions feel free to ask me.  Will definitely be doing this again -- I'm already putting together another haul for around Christmas.

We went through a lot of retail data and finally determined the meaning of each string in the product code.  https://preview.redd.it/faq6qzpifvm41.jpg?width=5906&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34e63a5cb7fcc7680e34e09768698cd881dfd852  Barcode tags, price tags, washing labels, size labels must be corresponding.  https://preview.redd.it/guu8ks5nfvm41.jpg?width=6803&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab724bca66ab073b8db635727c21e14183eeb681  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ftrt5ins80n41.jpg?width=4671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb4fb2b353dfca7776f47dac6531dea500bf55fe  **the loop pin is a proprietary mold production, 99.9 % of the remaker do not spend a huge cost to produce it.**  **I have found and contacted the original manufacturer of loop pin, but they require a minimum production quantity of 5 million pieces, which is a huge expense. I will produce it after selling 10,000 pieces of clothes.¬†It needs the help of repfams, and I hope that day will come soon.**  At the end of the post is a QC request. The following is my first batch of badges.

####Review: extremely satisfied with these, materials are great, did notice a couple glue marks and a bit of midsole misalignment, but thats just nitpicking. comfort isn‚Äôt on the same level as boost, obviously, but damn putting these on feels like a bear hug! upper is incredibly comfortable, and the midsole gives you a more stable feeling than boost, which some may prefer   #Chanel

LV,quality,"Cuban Link stainless steel Necklace and Bracelet set and LV Spaceman Keychain from HLin Jewelry ### W2C  * WhatsApp:  +86 156 2702 2716  * Website:  http:// hlinjewelry. x. yupoo. com  * Instagram:  hlinjew_official   * WeChat:  SAMHO-ZXH  * Mention REPREVIEW for $5 off  ### REVIEW   The necklace and bracelet are both heavy duty and sturdy and the links are clean and conformed. I pulled on the necklace with a little bit of torque to test its strength integrity and it stated intact. The clasps work well and don't get stuck and lock in place easily and unclasp easily. Not really much else to review for them, they feel like a good quality Cuban link chain set. I did do a lead test on them and they came up negative for lead. I included a photo at the end.   The LV Astronaut Spaceman keychain from what I can tell based on comparing them to photos looks good. The LV engravings are clean and centered and placed well. The LV text on the key ring looks spaced well and placed evenly. The LV engravings on the clip looks clean and has good size and placed well. A few nitpicky things I noticed that weren't the same is the LV on the chest has wider top lines and the circle in the bottom right is smaller on the real one. Also the engravings on the back is not as clean and text is a little off. Also tested this for lead and it came back negative. Overall a solid LV keychain rep.   ### Experience with Seller  This is my second time dealing with HLin and communication and responsiveness was good. They answered all my questions and QC and shipping was very fast. I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for quality jewelry reps with great customer service.

I also only added the QC pics, but if you need a better pic just comment or DM me.  Stats: 6'1"" and 155lbs. I usually wear size M shirts and 32 pants  **Cross Patterned Pants**  Price -  69 CNY, 9.75 USD  Review - Slim fit tailored, unbranded, and decent quality. I'm a big fan of these. Size was good for me  **Stainless Steel Ring**  Price -  19.90 CNY, 2.81 USD  Review - As advertised  **Maroon Bomber Jacket**  Price -  52 CNY, 7.35 USD  Review - Very thin and cheap, zippers don't work super well. The length is good but its slim-fitting. I wouldn't bother with it, even for the price  **Law of Nature Hoodie**  Price -  42.25 CNY, 5.97 USD  Review - Material is very fleece-y. Print looks good but the fit is kinda tight.  **Charmander AJ1**  Price -  231 CNY, 32.64 USD  Review - Super dope, big fan of these lol. True to size  **Burberry Button Down**  Price -  98.70 CNY,  USD  Review - Inside neck tag is not very good, but the rest of the shirt is fine. Size L worked for me but is slim, size up if you want it a bit more leeway  **Alexander Wang Barcode tee**  Price -  35 CNY, 4.94 USD  Review - Pretty good for the price. Size worked for me.  **Stone Island Patch Tee**  Price -  95 CNY, 13.42 USD  Review - Huge fan- great quality, decent price, good fit, and I love the green.  **Womens Leather Jacket**  Price -  99 CNY, 14 USD  Review - Not high quality leather obviously, but it looks good enough from a step away  **Dragon crop top**  Price -  28 CNY, 4 USD  Review - Pretty much as advertised  **Patagonia Sweater**  Price -  149 CNY, 21.05 USD  Review - Logo looks fine enough. The material is definitely not as nearly as thick or good as retail but you wouldn't really know until you put it on. M works well enough for me but consider going a size up. Honestly, just buy retail Patagonias, they're a great company with quality products and they're not really overpriced  **Denim ~~Chicken~~Jacket**  Price -  48 CNY, 6.78 USD  Review - Nice jacket, especially for the price. Wide fit but the sleeves are just a hair short for me I think  **Leather Jacket**  Price -  65 CNY, 9.18 USD  Review - Gave this away because it was too small. Very slim fitting and needs to be sized up a few times. Quality is not good and zipper sucks. I wouldn't bother with this.  **Burberry Plain Button Up**  Price -  89 CNY, 12.57 USD  Review - Far too small, I saw this from another user and knew I should have sized up more but went with the size chart unfortunately. Neck tag logo is decent  **Women's CDG Cardigan**  Price -  79.90 CNY, 11.29 USD  Review - Pretty nice, material is super soft. Logo and tag are decent  **Maison Kitsune Fox Embroidered Tee**  Price -  58.80 CNY, 8.31 USD  Review - Big fan of this. Good quality shirt with nice embroidery and a good fit. The real version is supposed to be Ader Error x Maison Kitsune and this says CINS error, but their pics show CINS so I knew what I was getting. The link with the Ader error verison was sold out and this was the only other one I could find but I'm totally fine with it.   **Three Stripe Joggers**  Price -  15 CNY, 2.12 USD  Review - Lmao just got these because they were so cheap. I was worried because the from the QC it looked like they were gonna be way to wide, but I actually like the fit. They're wide and comfy around the leg but the elastic ankle still brings it in. Low quality but soft and comfy. Would probably size up again for more length.  **North Face Jacket**  Price -  79 CNY, 11.16 USD  Review - Actually not bad. I thought it was just going to be a cheap, thin shell, but it has fleece inside and is sorta thicker. Logos are decent but the care tag is rife with misspellings lol. Too small for me so size up more.  **Patagonia Long Sleeve Tee**  Price -  39 CNY, 5.51 USD  Review - Print is good. Size L is perfect if you dont like oversized long sleeve tees. The sleeve ends on these are just hemmed and not elastic like some other long sleeves. Not sure which the retails are though.  **Print Tees**  Price -  39 CNY, 5.51 USD  Review - XXL worked out for me. These have super wide neck holes though, I wouldn't bother with the off white versions.  **Blue Camo Jacket**  Price -  142 CNY, 20 USD  Review - Not bad, but not great quality. The site pics say ""Off Whate"" so i was worried, but there's no text on the actual jacket. Sleeves are kinda short so size up more  **TWICE Stickers**  Price -  10 CNY, 1.40 USD  Review - Haha I had to do it  **Stone Island Compass Tee**  Price -  45 CNY, 6.36 USD  Review - decent shirt and nice fit. Back graphic looks fins now but I'm worried it'll wear easily  **FG reflective tee**  Price -  67 CNY, 9.47 USD  Review - Huge fan of this. Great quality shirt and decent price. Must cop. Fitting is good too  **Saint Laurent Ring**  Price -  60.80 CNY, 8.59 USD  Review - As advertised so far  **Gentle Monster Sunglasses**  Price -  89 CNY, 12.57 USD  Review - These are great. Polarized lenses, great quality, comes with all the packaging. Unisex style and they look and feel great  **Canada Goose Sweater**  Price -  69 CNY, 9.75 USD  Review - Great cop. I wanted white but they were out of stock, but the blue is great too. Fit is perfect - TTS. Badge very decent. Would recommend  **Maison Kitsune Lovebirds Embroidered Tee**  Price -  105 CNY, 14.83 USD  Review - I love the look of this shirt. The quality is great too and the embroidery is really nice. Would recommend.  **Cargo Tech Pants**  Price -  89 CNY, 12.57 USD  Review - Meh, quality is not that great and even the XXL were kinda short.;;""Tees and Jackets"" first pic is trousers..  lol jk nice review","{upvote:2,timestamp:2020-06-29}",Reddit,1,1

"LV,Burberry,YSL","quality,haul","[Review] Big Clothing Haul from Made by KungFu | Superbuy [Chrome Hearts Cashmere Sweater Size S](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6766708432)   Overall Quality of the Knitted Cashmere Sweater is great, I own other retail cashmere products and was shook when i unboxed it. It has a super nice soft touch and feels very nice wearing, most items feel rather scratchy but this one does not have that issue. Nice fabric quality is a major factor for me when i buy rep items so this is definitely a win for me. The Leather patches are Soft leather and feel super smooth, on the back there is a 925 Silver Chrome Hearts Badge, no clue if it actually is silver but it compares to my other silver products that i own. I also made a close up macro picture of the Fabric with my 15 pro max for those interested. Personally I'd give this product a high recommendation for those people who are interested in good fabric products.

[Yves Saint Laurent Flower Silk Shirt Size 37](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6632387582)  I'm a huge fan of silk products and own many many silk items so getting KungFu his silk products was a no brainer for me. The flower shirt is rather on the thinner side of silk(which is not bad), I'd consider it a Summer shirt, if i had to guess i would say its 16 momme. The silk quality is outstanding though and feels super nice on the body, definitely one of the more comfortable items.  &#x200B;  [YSL Flower Silk Shirt](https://preview.redd.it/7ag4le0kpp5c1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ac6a69d352c0fc1dccf3d845f9ea38375ef0891)  3. [Yves Saint Laurent Black Silk Shirt Size 37](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6765701081)  Like the flower shirt, this is just a great piece even though they are different. The black silk shirt is definitely thicker compared to the flower shirt I'd assume its 19 momme hence it makes the silk feel even softer/smoother, big recommend.  [YSL Silk Shirt in Black](https://preview.redd.it/gnx9fsprpp5c1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=032bd0d7433aba1b3419581ddb99fecfabb5cbfc)  4. [MiuMiu Polo Sweater Size S](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6765710783)  Personally one of my ""bigger favorites"" I have always been a massive fan of MiuMiu, so seeing a rep of it getting made definitely made me happy so i had to get it. It's very oversized and gives a boxy look, the length is more fitted and has the bottom similar to a bomber so its snug on the body, inside feels similar to fleece fabric so it has a high wear comfort. The logo also has a really good placement, i attached a picture of it.  [MiuMiu Sweater Polo Front](https://preview.redd.it/stw4ih82qp5c1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8957a8d719d484df8ac6d74e3f667605461c8976)  [MiuMiu Close up of Logo](https://preview.redd.it/oc4rsde3qp5c1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=848d945446ade939ca9de07ac0a38d9008954380)  5. [Burberry Rain/Trench coat Size S](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6707621849)  The Burberry Trench feels like every other Raincoat. The alignment of the Burberry checker logo is really good and compares to my retail products i have from Burberry. It's reversible and also has a black side with a Burberry Badge (stitching is decent on it). The black inside is waterproof i also tested it and it works just fine so definitely a good cop for when it rains.  [Burberry Trench Front](https://preview.redd.it/mt5saamaqp5c1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc2233e5bff8f2eb603bd1cccda61c65cff21c6b)  6. [Fendi Shirt Jacket Size S](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6632428058&spider_token=f83a)  I like Fendi a lot and I'm into the Shirt Jacket style so i gave it a try, most of those Fendi items always have a problem with alignment. The one from KungFu is decent compared to others but the alignment of the pockets still could have been better. Overall the quality of it is good, the inside is nylon I'm pretty sure but doesn't feel that plasticy so it's nice to wear. For people that like Fendi and this style I'd recommend it but for those that are rather nit picky about alignment and everything i would not buy it even though I've seen better pieces than mine from KungFu but i do not mind it much.  [Fendi Shirt Jacket Front](https://preview.redd.it/1sacl20gqp5c1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5439f63ff07acc6b40fe9c1039ce0536ae07257a)  7. [Maison Margiela Suit Set Size 48](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6632453324)  The Margiela Suit is really nice compared to other Suits i had before, Fabric is good Quality and the open style of the suit top definitely makes it look more ""casual"" to wear which i really like a lot, Pants are straight cut and look good when wearing, but are a bit tight on the waist so i should definitely have went a size up. The sewing of the Tag is also good and shows good alignment of the back and is very symmetric. I got a retail Margiela hoodie and the Tag sewing looks pretty much the same.  [Margiela Top and Pants](https://preview.redd.it/k6hwoxykqp5c1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72e4d5973d6c9988a6737600d5ab03bfe5203519)  For Shipping i've used Superbuy since their service is always outstanding and i always get great help from my friend u/TommySuperbuy regarding any issues I've ever had, so I highly recommend their service.

Tommy Hilfiger,quality,"Can we please talk about quality So my closet now pretty much consists of only replica Hoodies, except one Retail Tommy Hilfiger Hoodie which my grandma bought me a year ago. It was too big for me until I tried it on again yesterday and I fucking love it. I don't really like the design but the quality is so fucking good. Tommy Hilfiger Hoodies are like 100.- CHF (in Switzerland) and of course you can say that the quality is because the Hoodies are so expensive, but you know, it's also expensive because of the brand.  So why do I still not see any reps with that quality? I've got a Heron Hoodie from Vetementsshop, which people told me has the best quality Hoodies on here (and the Hoodies are also on the pricier side compared to other sellers), but it still doesn't come to close to the quality of the Tommy Hilfiger Hoodie I got.  I mean, cmon, you're paying 60$-80$ for a replica Hoodie and it still hasn't the quality like retail? Am I seeing this wrong or do you guys agree with me on this?;;Repmakers judge quality on aesthetics - if it looks like the real thing, it's 'good quality'. The quality of the blank is secondary and more often than not doesn't fit into the assessment of whether something looks similar to retail.

Got all these from her, been lurking her Yupoo for a long time, sent I don‚Äôt know how many messages asking about prices and quality before finally placing an order. She was always super helpful, I half expected her to start ignoring me eventually, but she was always responsive. Got a Goyard wallet for myself, and a Goyard wallet, a Goyard ticket holder and a Gucci purse. All the Goyard is Afen factory, and the purse is Orange Sofa. I originally sent Scarlet a different link for the purse to as her about it, but she sent me the Orange Sofa link (which was only a little more) and was like, ‚ÄúGet this one, your wife will much happier with it‚Äù.   I‚Äôm not an expert on these by any stretch, but the quality of materials and construction are excellent and the accuracy is incredible in my opinion. I‚Äôm really interested to hear anyone‚Äôs opinion on these, as again, I am not an expert, I‚Äôm mostly a sneaker guy. My wife for her part is really knowledgeable, and has a bunch of retail Chloe and YSL (she has had LV in the past but has been kinda over it). She was really impressed with the quality as well.

Shit, it‚Äôs been months since I‚Äôve even done a haul. I‚Äôve mainly been looking for some rarer pieces and items that are looking like they‚Äôre low on stock with little hope of restocking.

Rhude‚Äôs been growing as my favorite brand for the past couple of years and I‚Äôm super excited to see a lot of their stuff being repped lately.

From u/FashionAngelKing ([angelking47.x.yupoo.com](http://angelking47.x.yupoo.com/)) he has definitely become my go-to for these. The White with Yellow Print version has been my favorite tee for close to a year now and I‚Äôve been sleeping on getting the others. The main reason I went with Angel for these is because I‚Äôve actually gotten to see the production process for these which makes me trust him for them rather than middle man sellers.¬†   >   >¬†The only retail version of the Moonlit Tee I‚Äôve held in hand was the Black with Blue Print and I would definitely say it is softer, to be fair it‚Äôs from a completely different season / year so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Rhuigi changed the material. I‚Äôve ordered that one from Angel as well so I will definitely review that once I have it in hand. For these, the material is definitely thicker and what I‚Äôd describe as ‚Äúrougher‚Äù if that makes any sense. So I can‚Äôt really say how close the material and feel is to retail of these, but I can definitely say they are quality tees. Nice material and a somewhat ‚Äúheavy‚Äù feel to them.¬†   >   >Ngl, the accuracy is honestly perfect. Retail batches had different distressing on the logos so it 100% passes as retail for looks. Only r/FashionReps users would be able to call you out that it‚Äôs a rep because all of the tees in this batch have the same distressing, really not a big deal. You can see the signature Rhude stitching on the back of the neck which is great as well. I‚Äôm hoping that the logos will fade over time similar to the White / Yellow version I‚Äôve had for awhile now. At first it was mainly solid black but now it has a black acid-wash look to it.   >   >Super unlucky but I accidentally had my dryer set to high when I usually put it on extra low and delicate for all my clothes.

If you look at his side by side pics it‚Äôs practically 1:1 to the retail he has / had in hand. This is from a very early season from about 2-3 years ago and is definitely a different, thinner material compared to all of the other Rhude tees I‚Äôve seen. Definitely not a bad thing, I still like the feel of it and would recommend if you like it.   >   >The Swarovski crystals shine like crazy when exposed to direct sunight / light in general, has a rainbow disco effect. I really fuck with the whole tee, idk why lol.

I came across this reddit after seeing a lot of videos/pictures of the hyped Jordan 1 sneaker trend and wanted to jump onto the bandwagon though did not want to spend a fortune buying those coveted pieces.  Not that I'm too worried about being 'called out'  but I wanted to make sure what I bought was good quality an as close to retail as possible.  The posts on here (specially the ""Amazing Review"") helped me a lot in shortlisting and finding the items I wanted to purchase. Would like to thank all those who post detailed reviews and help out noobs with a ton of information.  \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  # Personal Stats  5'10 Athletic/ Part time gym build¬†  Clothing Size: M (L for baggy fit)  Waist: 34 inches  Shoes: UK9  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  # Haul Detail  **Submitted :** 04 July 23  **Received :** 15 July 23  **Agent : Pandabuy**  **Shipping Agent: PD-EMS**  **Location : London (UK)**  **Weight: 9.25 Kg**  **Declared amount: $110**  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/5ud785yjfcib1.png?width=1940&format=png&auto=webp&s=99542574e9da1c9694c42cd5a2fa2e2826d67f09  &#x200B;  **Review**   Not overly impressed by PD-EMS. The parcel was manhandled and severely deformed on arrival. The deformation caused all the shoes to have some deformation and was not a good sight to see. Thankfully, they regained their shape after some tlc but lesson learnt of adding Parcel reinforcement in my next haul  The parcel sat in China till 09 July before being dispatched to the UK.  Pandabuy agents were extremely helpful and were ready to help me out with claiming insurance if I wanted to (though I was too lazy to go this route). Alternatively, they offered me a 75¬• shipping coupon to be used up for my next purchase.  &#x200B;  \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  # Shoes  **Travis Scott Black Phantom**  Price: ¬• 410.00 ( ¬• 10.00 - Shipping)  [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=5296282013&spider_token=4572) //[ QC](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=8A9D4FE8F2DD31A87427E57865C810E0)  Rating 9/10¬†  These are the shoes that got me looking for reps. I had seen them on-foot a couple of times and fell head over heels. Unfortunately, the price of them got me to the ground but I kept pining for them and what led me to the reps rabbit hole.  These are TTS. Very comfortable and looks great. Have not worn them out a lot (only get them out for special occasions) but have been complimented whenever I have them on. Probably the best item on my haul.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  **Nike Dunk Low (Varsity Green)**  Price: ¬• 190.00 ( ¬• 10.00 - Shipping)  [QC](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=769A71B644A92E91F1C59899E74955AE) //[ W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4968759438&spider_token=4572)   Rating 10/10¬†  Shipped these without the box so they were a little beat up when they arrived.

The blank is a really nice quality. The print is fine and feels very well put together and is heavy.

Cartier,"quality,price,haul","FIRST REVIEW: 25 Yuan Cartier Bracelet GENERAL INFORMATION: I decided to test out this 25 yuan (‚âà$4) Cartier bracelet. I paid an additional 35 yuan (‚âà$5) for the packaging. The packaging and bracelet link is in the caption of the photos. I am around 6‚Äô1 and I weigh around 170 lbs for general idea on how it fits on my wrist.  SHIPPING EXPERIENCE: I shipped this bracelet out with Pandabuy as part of my haul. The package was 3350 grams and it cost me 690 yuan ($100) to ship out using the GD-EMS shipping line. In terms of my experience with Pandabuy, it was great. The whole purchasing process was very smooth as usual, and they were very quick to pack and ship out my haul. It took around 16 days to come which is very quick considering it being delivered around Christmas time. I will admit that it was a little pricey to ship out (around $33/kg). I rate my experience with Pandabuy a 9.4/10.  ITEM REVIEW: For the overall price, I would say the bracelet is very good. For $4, the bracelet is extremely sturdy and it feels very durable. I definitely think it was last a long time. The screwdriver item in the bracelet box is used to unscrew the sides to be able to put on the bracelet. I will most likely be buying lead testing swabs just to ensure it is completely safe to wear. The packaging is very high quality and visually appealing. I highly recommend also buying the packaging with it. The diamonds on the bracelet are alright. They reflect some light when I shine my phone flashlight on them, but, it isn‚Äôt anything crazy. The bracelet has the Cartier branding on the inside, and it looks very good at a quick glance. I took a shower with it on, and it remained perfectly fine. I measured my wrist which turned out to be around 17.5cm. I ordered the 18cm size for the bracelet, and I can only get it on by unscrewing both sides and reattaching them. I definitely recommend ordering around 1-2cm sizes up. However, overall, I think this is a very good bracelet for the price and I would recommend buying it since it practically costs nothing to ship out if you‚Äôre building a haul. I rate the bracelet a 9.2/10;;Waiting for lead test results","{upvote:57,timestamp:2023-01-01}",Reddit,0,

The only complaint I have with these is that even though I sized up the waist is MASSIVE. I'm going to get them tailored then they should be good. Accuracy wise these aren't awful but they are far from 1:1. Starting out with the gray color it is noticably darker than retail, the ""fear of god"" logos in the denim are super faded and are pretty much not visible.   Edit: I got them tailored and these are one of the favorite pieces I‚Äôve ever copped once they fit. They fit baggy for sure but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd expect from any fog piece. Super high quality and the only gripe I have with them is that the only pockets on these are Velcro so whenever I want to put something in its loud as fuck. Plus once something like my phone is in the pants it weighs them down a ton and I have to keep readjusting the belt so they don‚Äôt fall down.  **Overall: 7/10**  **UPDATED SCORE 10/10**  &nbsp;  **Gallery Dept.

These are definitely 1:1 as all retail pieces have randomized paint splatters. The gallery text looks good. Not a whole lot to say about these I'm just in love with the design.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **AMIRI Paint Splatter Distressed Jeans**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.1-c-s.w4004-23108456496.49.1eee1300cetf5i&id=618934882467)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Eu0yqM6) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/3asfMvP)  * Size: Sized up (31) I normally take a 29  * Color: Black  * Price: $26.31  Compared to the pics on the store page I got shafted and I'm not sure if its just by luck or what but the store pics have a lot more streaks of paint but I got more splatters and dots. Fit wise these are tight and if anyone else would want to buy I'd reccomend sizing up three sizes. Also these fit skinny which I'm not used to so It's somewhat uncomfortable but I'm fairly certain I can get used to it.  **Overall: 6/10**  &nbsp;  #Crewnecks and Long Sleeves  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God Essentials Crewneck (x2)**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.6f882e8dL8cZOu&id=609557178678&_u=g3rb200hc8dc)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/31ywdVq) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/CsiajD2)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Beige & Gray  * Price: $12.43 each  These are great. Super comfortable blank, amazing oversized fit, very minimal branding, and the only thing I can pick at accuracy wise between these two is the gray crewneck's cuff edges seem to be slightly miscolored but other than that these are perfect.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God Essentials High Collar Mock Neck**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=627201742749)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/tMno5AV) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/2VM1ke1)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Black  * Price: $22.68  I love the fit of this piece, perfectly oversized FOG fit. I originally ordered the gray green color and I was sent the wrong color and was refused an exchange. The black colorway is still really nice though absolutely no complaints.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Kith mini logo long sleeve shirt**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=623556732746)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/ZiU4ymw) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/7sN2j4k)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: Light Blue  * Price: $12.41  This piece is insanely thin and fits way too big. Gonna get it tailored and after that I think it will be decent at best.  **Overall: 4/10**  &nbsp;  **Kith x Coca Cola Crewneck**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.1-c-s.w4004-17080473757.12.465693918eOmex&id=605439218743)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/wGFeS9x) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/SfLCLcN)  * Size: TTS (M)  * Color: White  * Price: $18.69  Super comfortable fleece lining although it is on a pretty thin blank. Fits oversized. The embroidery is pretty shit but from a distance looks fine but close up its super messy and has a lot of exposed spots and loose threads.  **Overall: 7/10**  &nbsp;  #Windbreakers  &nbsp;  **Fear Of God Essentials Reflective Windbreaker**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3948163902&spider_token=dcee)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/QxiwB8Q) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/ssyr7b8)  * Size: Sized Down (S)  * Color: Silver (reflective)  * Price: $14.49  The fit is really good and oversized. From my original QC pics it looked like the essentials badge was super crooked but in person its fine. Whenever you move in it it's so fucking loud its pretty much unbearable to wear indoors. Also I can't state how awful it smelled out of the bag but after a wash it was fine.  **Overall: 7/10**  &nbsp;  #Footwear  &nbsp;  **Nike x Peaceminusone Paranoise AF1**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3344366024&spider_token=803c)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/gallery/NURJEBG) | [In-Hand and without paint](https://imgur.com/gallery/BcG38To)  * Batch: H12  * Price: $61.06  Absolutely in love with these. Definitely a criminally underrated pair. The primary flaws are the paint streaks on the midsole and the paint underneath is slightly too dull. If you're willing to shell out more money go with OG batch which is more accurate but will run you double.  **Overall: 10/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike x Travis Scott Sail Air Force 1**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3333472335)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/qDKjxXM) | [In-Hand with 3M](https://imgur.com/a/ZkH9Qib)  * Batch: H12  * Price: $53.61  Definitely one of the higher ranking travis collabs. Only large flaw I can pick out is the weak 3m around the eyelets although it is more noticable in person than on cam.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike x Travis Scott SB Dunk**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3604350235)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/a3QC3JT) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/CBykhMS)  * Batch: 290 cny batch  * Price: $43.19  Probably my second favorite travis shoe the first being the 1 Lows. These look great to my untrained eye.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike x CLOT Air Force 1**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3553595949)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/zGb7B32) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/RiZ8NM6)  * Batch: unknown  * Price: $34.25  In the original QCs taken by WGB its impossible to tell but in person the soles of the two shoes are noticably different colors. The tongue of the shoe is a stiff leather and it's uncomfortable against my ankles. Also the tongue squeaks a lot when it rubs against the shoe which gets annoying pretty quick. They look clean AF tho  **Overall: 7/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike x CPFM Vapormax**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3781843383&spider_token=db41)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/6qLE5q2) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/pIOXZqx)  * Batch: Wood Table Guy (WTG)  * Price: $14.27  For the price you can absolutely do no wrong with this one. The heel part of the shoe can scratch against your ankle which gets annoying but other than that they're great  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Jordan 1 Obsidian**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3055745180&a=b&spm=1101.1101.N.N.bc4a1a6)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/EZEu0FM) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/S9dYMeo)  * Batch: Wood Table Guy (WTG)  * Price: $29.96  TikTok shoe.  **Overall: 9/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike SB Dunk Low Paris**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=2617437910&spider_token=6372)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Zly8JaU) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/oWaCfmp)  * Batch: unknown  * Price: $25.96  Accuracy wise these are awful but I couldn't care less. If anyone is able to ID these shoes on feet they'll know they're reps in an instant as there's no way in hell I'm rocking 60k shoes. The tongue was thin AF so I stuffed it myself. Not aware of any other batches out so if you want a pair of paris dunks you're probably stuck with these.  **Overall: 10/10**  &nbsp;  **Nike SB Dunk Low Tiffany**  **W2C:** [Mr. Hou](https://houyw.x.yupoo.com/)  **Pics:** NO QC PICS | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/Knkvyso)  * Batch: PK  * Price: $62  Overall I got pretty unlucky but I'm not upset about these at all. The croc isn't printed deep enough and is not nearly as shiny as retail.

The only thing I was able to find which is pretty miniscule at that is the left UN/LA tag is slightly smaller than the right. Otherwise these are amazing and the best batch out and for $100 cheaper than what UABAT sells these for on his site it's impossible to say no.  **Overall: 10/10**  &nbsp;  **Dior B23**  **W2C:** [weidian](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3795854538&spider_token=1be7)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Ir2QydU) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/BcZNNru)  * Batch: Wood Table Guy (WTG)  * Price: $32.51  These are far from good but for a budget batch I was not going to complain. They have the dio flaw which is common amongst budget batches which is the glaring flaw. When I first got these they were uncomfortable as fuck but became decent after 2 wears. If you've looking for a better batch definitely check out LY who have the best rn AFAIK.  **Overall: 8/10**  &nbsp;  **VISVIM slides**  **W2C:** [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=565477817964)  **Pics:** [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Cs0zuf2) | [In-Hand](https://imgur.com/a/pNZyIad)  * Batch: unknown  * Price: $19.27  These are comfy af and look good as hell. not much else to say  **Overall: 10/10**;;Nice haul & review homie.

"H&M,Uniqlo",,"[PSA] Hong Kong Black clothing crackdown/Reasoning for protests/ Some Fast Facts ***TL;DR : If you are not a Hong Kong RepFam or seller shipping to Hong Kong you do not have to worry about the ban, To an extent.***  &#x200B;  As many of you are aware, As the Hong Kong protests grows in velocity China has admitted a crackdown against couriers getting shipments of black clothing into the island of Hong Kong (As well as Gas masks/Normal masks, Umbrellas, sticks/batons and any other items that can or has been used in mass by the mobs)  ***But Why ?***  Black clothing Is a staple in the protests as a means of camouflaging into the crowds. To combat a influx of new protesters. It has been said that they are seizing ""Bulk"" amounts of black clothing (Anything over the amount of five) But some say that individual packages with black clothes are being seized.  ***When can black items get back into shipping to the Island ?***  It is currently unknown when mass shipments will be allowed. As the protests are said to be dwindling by some, But on the rise by others. Major retailers like H&M and Uniqlo  are still selling and wearing black clothing.  ***Why are the protests happening ?***  Several reasons; It was initially over a Extradition bill, Made by the Hong Kong Government which would enable local law enforcement and police to extradite criminals who where wanted in territories that Hong Kong doesn't have extradition laws set in (Mostly applies to Taiwan and China) which has been claimed to ""Undermine Hong Kong Autonomy"" In its region  The bill has now since been suspended as of the First of July. But since the protests have escalated to reasons of:  * The obvious withdrawal of the Extradition Bill * A free self governed HK * The use of police force, After a Indonesian protester was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet, And permanently blinded in her right eye, after the force of the bullet ruptured her eye and was soon flooded with blood in her pupil * For Carrie Lam, Chief Executive Of Hong Kong to Resign * The ban of face masks used in protests, Leading up to fines of HK$25,000 ($3,000 USD) * Release of Protesters who had been tracked down via private medical documents and arrested  There are still several underlying causes to the protests, and several of these requests have been filled and dealt with.  Hong Kong wishing to be free from Beijing's Grip after the UK had no longer had declared it a British colony in 1997, And wishes to be a self governing country.  ***So why should I give a damn about all of this ?***  The tensions may not just affect our budget Ultra-boosts or Box logos, They may even cause global changes in economy and region control.  ***And now for some facts***  * Pepe the Frog has been embraced as a Progressive image of battling against Authoritarian control. He has been found in graffiti, Protest clothing, Stickers and even dolls of him have been included in a hand-hold ring protest * Common items used during the protests consist of: Rods/Sticks, Umbrellas, Gas Mask/Construction helmet, all black outfit, spray paint, hammers and in more drastic situations Molotov cocktails/petrol bombs * Majority of the police force is Pro-Beijing * Jimmy Sham, One of the leading activists in the situation was mugged and beaten by four men with hammers and machetes, on his way to a conference.  * 71% Of people Do not Identify as Chinese in Hong Kong, They state they are ""Hong Kongers"" as they do not feel proud to identify as Chinese * There is another county similar to Hong Kong, Known as Macau, And is just due west of HK across the Pearl River Delta. Both are known as a ""Special Administrated Region"" * Macau is considered as the ""Vegas of Asia"" As it is known for its tourism and vast casinos * Macau is the Hub/window of the outside world for North Korean government officials, As North Korean activity has been present there since the 1970's and is considered as the base of operations for CN/NK Relations.  If you read this far into this class presentation of a Reddit post, Thank you. I apologize if there are any grammatical errors or source errors but I definitely suggest you look further into this, especially if you are into global relations or just current Asian history.

"Nike,Hermes,Gucci,Dior","quality,price,haul,popular","7kg Haul [Warehouse Review] CDG, Vlone, Dior, SI, Dsquared2, Amiri, OW-Nike Sup fam, here's my latest haul that I just shipped today. Been building this one for a few months now. QC's are appreciated but not necessary, more or less just wanted to share my haul.  I plan to do a full review with this haul and another summer haul I'm currently building once I have everything in-hand so stay tuned!  **Weight: 72kg**    **Height: 6'2**   **Waist size: 32**    **Shoe Size: US12/ 46**  Usually wear L in retail for shirts and tops, most reps I buy tend to be XL since I'm a lanky dude  **HERE IS THE IMGUR ALBUM (LINKS IN DESCRIPTION): https://imgur.com/a/wSpTXsr**   **EMS Boyz**  A couple things:  &nbsp;  **p200 OW Blazers (BM LIN:)** I originally ordered the p450 version, but the pair I got was fucked, the ""NIKE"" embossing on the back of the right shoe was embossed twice. Returned those and decided to go with the p200 batch, and it is quite clean for the price. Anon did a QC if you want to see it check my post history. &nbsp;   **CDG Tee (0832Club):** Was skeptical buying this piece as I had read that a lot of the newer tee shirts from 0832club were cheap blanks/ bad prints, but I am overall happy with this piece. The print is bold and the blank is decently thick, however I cannot compare to retail myself  &nbsp;   **Playboy VLONE (Ceaser):** This thing is pretty much perfect, bright colour on the print and V seems to be accurate size and placement. Reviewed a billion times.  &nbsp;  **Christian Dior Jean Jacket:** Got this one on sale for 135Y (I think down from 180?) It's hard to tell whether it's the wrinkling of the jacket but the lettering on the print on the back is not alligned, and same goes for the print on shoulder when comparing to some other RepFam's pictures of the same item. I didn't bother exchanging as I'm happy with how it looks and for the price it is a steal.    &nbsp;  **Soft Shell-R Jacket (TopStoney):** Been bought and reviewed countless times, I'm not the best at QCing the badges but when I first posted a QC I had some people commenting that the badge looked good. Overall comparing to other QC's the material seems correct and everything looks great.  &nbsp;  **DSquared2 Jeans (wongwoods):** First time buying jean replicas, curious to see how they will feel/fit. Overall they look really good for the pricepoint, and generally the rips/markings look very similar to how retail looks. When it comes to the details like zippers, buttons tags I believe it is quite off. I read on another review that the little red ""DSQUARED2"" tag near the front zipper is the wrong font and colour.   &nbsp;  **Amiri Patchwork Jeans (MadeByGU):** These were a grail for me since I came across some old QC's on DesignerReps from almost a year ago. The batch I was originally looking for was GodMaker's but that batch was long gone by the time I had begun searching. Eventually I found these by MadeByGU for 470Y. I am pretty impressed by the patches; they are very similar to retail and in my opinion uncalloutable. The splatters and the shape of the pants are also really good, don't think there is supposed to be splatter on the ""FREINDLY BAKERS"" patch. I really will not be able to fully review these until I have them in-hand, but for now I am quite pleased as to how these look.  &nbsp;  **Small Bracelet:** Saw someone wearing this in a WDYWT and liked it. Very cheap at 20y  &nbsp;  **Hermes Belts (x3):** Probably going to be the new GOYARD CARD HOLDER at this point with the amount I've been seeing this in hauls. Insanely cheap and from what I've read from other reviews the quality isn't bad and the belts are leather and not plastic.  &nbsp;  **Gucci Phone Case:** A phone case, been reviewed before. Took like a week to ship  &nbsp;  **Vetements Socks:** Probably some of the most popular socks on this sub, good for price, I'm also size 46 and these look stretchy unlike a lot of socks on this sub.  &nbsp;  Can't really give a ?/10 for each item until I have them in-hand.   &nbsp; &nbsp;   **EMS GANG**;;How‚Äôs the sizing on the Dior Jean Jacket?","{upvote:2,timestamp:2019-05-06}",Reddit,0,
"H&M,Uniqlo",,"[PSA] Hong Kong Black clothing crackdown/Reasoning for protests/ Some Fast Facts ***TL;DR : If you are not a Hong Kong RepFam or seller shipping to Hong Kong you do not have to worry about the ban, To an extent.***  &#x200B;  As many of you are aware, As the Hong Kong protests grows in velocity China has admitted a crackdown against couriers getting shipments of black clothing into the island of Hong Kong (As well as Gas masks/Normal masks, Umbrellas, sticks/batons and any other items that can or has been used in mass by the mobs)  ***But Why ?***  Black clothing Is a staple in the protests as a means of camouflaging into the crowds. To combat a influx of new protesters. It has been said that they are seizing ""Bulk"" amounts of black clothing (Anything over the amount of five) But some say that individual packages with black clothes are being seized.  ***When can black items get back into shipping to the Island ?***  It is currently unknown when mass shipments will be allowed. As the protests are said to be dwindling by some, But on the rise by others. Major retailers like H&M and Uniqlo  are still selling and wearing black clothing.  ***Why are the protests happening ?***  Several reasons; It was initially over a Extradition bill, Made by the Hong Kong Government which would enable local law enforcement and police to extradite criminals who where wanted in territories that Hong Kong doesn't have extradition laws set in (Mostly applies to Taiwan and China) which has been claimed to ""Undermine Hong Kong Autonomy"" In its region  The bill has now since been suspended as of the First of July. But since the protests have escalated to reasons of:  * The obvious withdrawal of the Extradition Bill * A free self governed HK * The use of police force, After a Indonesian protester was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet, And permanently blinded in her right eye, after the force of the bullet ruptured her eye and was soon flooded with blood in her pupil * For Carrie Lam, Chief Executive Of Hong Kong to Resign * The ban of face masks used in protests, Leading up to fines of HK$25,000 ($3,000 USD) * Release of Protesters who had been tracked down via private medical documents and arrested  There are still several underlying causes to the protests, and several of these requests have been filled and dealt with.  Hong Kong wishing to be free from Beijing's Grip after the UK had no longer had declared it a British colony in 1997, And wishes to be a self governing country.  ***So why should I give a damn about all of this ?***  The tensions may not just affect our budget Ultra-boosts or Box logos, They may even cause global changes in economy and region control.  ***And now for some facts***  * Pepe the Frog has been embraced as a Progressive image of battling against Authoritarian control. He has been found in graffiti, Protest clothing, Stickers and even dolls of him have been included in a hand-hold ring protest * Common items used during the protests consist of: Rods/Sticks, Umbrellas, Gas Mask/Construction helmet, all black outfit, spray paint, hammers and in more drastic situations Molotov cocktails/petrol bombs * Majority of the police force is Pro-Beijing * Jimmy Sham, One of the leading activists in the situation was mugged and beaten by four men with hammers and machetes, on his way to a conference.  * 71% Of people Do not Identify as Chinese in Hong Kong, They state they are ""Hong Kongers"" as they do not feel proud to identify as Chinese * There is another county similar to Hong Kong, Known as Macau, And is just due west of HK across the Pearl River Delta. Both are known as a ""Special Administrated Region"" * Macau is considered as the ""Vegas of Asia"" As it is known for its tourism and vast casinos * Macau is the Hub/window of the outside world for North Korean government officials, As North Korean activity has been present there since the 1970's and is considered as the base of operations for CN/NK Relations.  If you read this far into this class presentation of a Reddit post, Thank you. I apologize if there are any grammatical errors or source errors but I definitely suggest you look further into this, especially if you are into global relations or just current Asian history. Once again, Thank you !","{upvote:88,upvoteRatio:0.93,timestamp:2019-10-20}",Reddit,0,

[haul overview pic (all items)](https://imgur.com/a/4iNHwqO)  My birthday has just come and gone (can I get uhhh hbd in the comments?), and this haul was basically my gift to myself. Plus we're still in lockdown here down under so I wasn't spending money on anything else I guess. Quite a few GPs and random items I haven't seen before in the sub so hopefully there's a few things in here you haven't copped or don't know about yet. Kinda tired of seeing the same yeezy slides, Eric Emmanuel Shorts, and Travis merch every haul so I'm gonna be the change I want to see in the world.  I've decided to stick with the classic style of text review after my last post since it's more searchbar friendly and I can fit a more detailed review in, so if anyone made it here from the search bar then say hi ‚úåÔ∏è  \*\*\*  # Stats  **Age:** 22 üéÇ   **Height:** 170cm   **Weight:** 60kg   **Shoe/Penis Size:** US 10, EU 43/44   **Build Type:** Athletic, Lean   **Location:** Australia   **Shipping:** Shipped with GD-EMS and arrived in 7 days!

Let's get into it.  &#x200B;  # üß• Jackets/Hoodies/Crewnecks üß•  **Represent Split Flannel Shirt // ¬•188.00 // $30.42 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D630551460777&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=630551460777) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/VPI7zLD))  Size: M // Colour: colour matching   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 7/10 // Overall: 8/10   Weight: 377g  Thoughts:   This is a super cool piece, I love the split look with the two different coloured flannels. It's quite a bit lighter than I was expecting, feels almost more like a shirt than a flannel or jacket as the material is quite thin, but it's great for layering with a tee or long sleeve underneath. However, the actual material feels really nice - it's almost like a silky yet fluffy feel, super soft and cosy. Can recommend.  **Maison Kitsune Chillax Fox Patch Sweatshirt // ¬•199.00 // $30.89 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D630969342546&nTag=Bar-search&from=search-input&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=630969342546) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Tih1zhZ))  Size: L // Colour: Khaki   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 9/10 // Overall: 9/10   Weight: 459g  Thoughts:   Love this. The patch looks great, and the blank itself just feels amazing to wear. It has a really nice interior lining material which is super soft and warm. It's cool to have something that's a little bit more formal, I could see myself wearing this to the office when we're allowed back. Not really a complaint, but it's a little bit on the smaller size, seems like it only just fits. If you want a baggier or more oversized fit, check the size chart and then size up 1.  **Givenchy Refracted Embroidered Logo Hoodie // ¬•330.00 // $55.00 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D641647496661%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.e8d368f&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=641647496661&spm=1101.1101.N.N.e8d368f) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/eQMHkDw))  Size: M // Colour: black   Looks : 6/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 7/10   Weight: 828g  Thoughts:   Before this haul, I realised I didn't actually have just a plain black hoodie, so I wanted to get one with a real minimalist look. I loved the design of this, especially since it was embroidered. In-hand, the stitching is a little bit rough around the edges, but the logo is so small that it doesn't really matter unless you look too closely. Regardless, the blank is quite comfy and fits perfect. Recommend going TTS or size up 1 if you'd rather have an oversized fit. It's not crazy heavy, but feels warm and looks nice. The inner lining isn't anything special but if you're wearing a shirt underneath it's no issue. It's 100% been getting me through being locked down at home.  **Stone Island Shadow Project Gradient Sweater // ¬•198.00 // $32.36 USD**  (~~WeGoBuy~~ // ~~W2C~~ Dead // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/9R2X7jL))  Size: L // Colour: Blue and white   Looks : 6/10 // Feel: 7/10 // Overall: 6/10   Weight: 570g  Thoughts:   A pretty cool design for a sweater, however I feel like it looked better in the item pictures and QC than it did when it arrived. It's hard to explain, but in-hand the dark parts of the pattern coming through are quite pronounced so the colour bands don't seem quite as bold/strong. Other than that, it's fine to wear, it's slim fitting so it feels quite warm. Because it's a relatively thick knit, it feels a little bit scratchy at first but for the most part it's fine. If you really like the piece I'd say it's still a worthy cop, but it didn't wow me really.  **Ambition Nike Vintage Hoodie // ¬•145.00 // $23.85 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D614687794037%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.8a6fbda&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=614687794037&spm=1101.1101.N.N.8a6fbda) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/z7dtcst))  Size: S // Colour: Earthy   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 9/10 // Overall: 9/10   Weight: 720g  Thoughts:   Ok, I know I was talking about uncommon items and I know you already know about this one. I'm allowed one or two standards. Repfam staple item, not gonna talk much about it because it's been reviewed to death. Comfy. Fits big so size down. I bought this one because the one from my last review was too big and I gave it to my dad (he loves it). Moving on.  &#x200B;  # üëï Tees/Long Sleeves üëï  **Acne Studios Extorr Tee // ¬•169.00 // $27.35 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D617781679835&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=617781679835) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/f1Q8fHB))  Size: XS // Colour: Black   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 10/10 // Overall: 9/10   Weight: 362g  Thoughts:   I believe this is not actually the Navid tee as it says in the listing, but the Extorr tee instead (since the band around the neck is white). Regardless, this is a super awesome tee. The quality is great, type looks accurate. I don't know what the material is (it's sort of mesh-like?) but it's super comfy feeling ‚Äì heavy, a little bit of stretchiness, and soft. Definitely one of the best tees in the haul, it's a bit pricier since it's from topacney but he always delivers on quality. Just feels great to wear.  **Maison Kitsune Fox Head Patch Classic Tee // ¬•109.00 // $17.81 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fspm%3Da230r.1.999.82.7bcb523c8UdzYM%26id%3D642809187418%26ns%3D1%23detail) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.999.82.7bcb523c8UdzYM&id=642809187418&ns=1#detail) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/2ORtLHn))  Size: L // Colour: Navy   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 8/10   Weight: 176g  Thoughts:   Just like the sweatshirt, the patch quality is really decent, looks embroidered properly. The tee blank is nothing extraordinary but feels like a regular tee. It's also on the smaller size, so definitely go a size or two up with this one. Not much else to say, it's just a very solid shirt.  **Stussy Stonehenge Hiver 2020 T-Shirt // ¬•68.00 // $11.19 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D637614912595&nTag=Bar-search&from=search-input&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=637614912595) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/7dwj7sZ))  Size: XL // Colour: White   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 9/10   Weight: 270g  Thoughts:   Love love love the design of this tee. The colours really pop on white and the iridescent colour scheme is sick. The print quality is really nice too, the artwork looks really great in hand and is quite vivid. It's pretty thick and heavy so it feels great to wear. The text is a little bit fuzzy (seems like it has a tiny bit of bleed) but if anything, I think it adds to the effect. It's a cop for sure, but definitely check the size guide measurements, because I typically wear M and I copped an XL for this one after cross checking the size guide, and the XL fits pretty well.  **Alyx 1017 9sm Visual Roll Long Sleeve Turtleneck // ¬•168.00 // $21.06 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D610502933825&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=610502933825) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/e46mQcU))  Size: M // Colour: black   Looks : 6/10 // Feel: 7/10 // Overall: 6/10   Weight: 252g  Thoughts:   This one is interesting, I like the minimalist design, and the material feels quite nice, however the part around the neck is quite loose for something that's similar to a turtleneck (even though I think it's technically a shirt). It means there's a bit more breathing room but it does look a bit strange, especially if the rolled part isn't flipped quite right. The text print on the neck looks really nice and well aligned, however it's printed on so I'd be careful when washing it or it could peel/scratch off. Hasn't happened yet but I'm just wary. Probably still worth a cop if you like the specific piece though, as it feels nice enough to wear and looks clean.  **Heron Preston CTNMB Long Sleeve // ¬•88.00 // $14.48 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D638396998268&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=638396998268) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Vs6dlU3))  Size: M // Colour: white   Looks : 7/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 8/10   Weight: 445g  Thoughts:   Now this is a pretty nice long sleeve. Feels very thick and hefty, the patches and stitching are really good for the most part. It's actually quite good for layering (I'm gonna bring back wearing a long sleeve shirt under a t-shirt and there's nothing you can do to stop me). The fit is good, perhaps even a little large so you could even afford to size down 1 if you want a more slim fit. It's perfect if you want everyone who sees you wearing it to ask what the Russian means and if you speak it (it's ""style"" btw).  **Cav Empt The End Product T-Shirt // ¬•109.00 // $17.93 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D638310397821&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=638310397821) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/eBrxdxT))  Size: L // Colour: black   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 7/10 // Overall: 7/10   Weight: 313g  Thoughts:   It's weird this tee is pretty much as 7/10 as it gets for a rep, to the point where there's not a lot I can say with it. The print is great, the blank feels ok, and it fits fine. It's a pretty cool graphic, although the random text is a bit strange. Decent cop, if you like the design there's no reason not to. Really can't think of much else to say.  **Cav Empt Lacquer Overdye Tee // ¬•88.00 // $14.48 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D638355546194&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=638355546194) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/2D6ttKj))  Size: S // Colour: black   Looks : 6/10 // Feel: 7/10 // Overall: 6/10   Weight: 286g  Thoughts:   This shirt has a pretty sick design honestly, and it is in fact embroidered (not screen printed). The stitching is a bit crap on the central logo ‚Äì a few threads joining the letters together ‚Äì but you can fix this up pretty easily with a bit of DIY. Again, it's just an average feeling tee, nothing special, but pretty cool just for the design alone. Cav Empt really does come up with some wacky out there graphics, and personally I think that's a plus.  **Kith Treats Locale Tokyo Tee // ¬•115.00 // $18.92 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?nTag=Home-search&from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D638809803514&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=638809803514) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/GnKn8Xr))  Size: S // Colour: White sunrise   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 9/10 // Overall: 9/10   Weight: 253g  Thoughts:   My other favourite tee from the haul. The blank is super nice, fits perfect, and the artwork is amazing. Super simple logo on the front, and the reverse looks great too. This'll be a great one going into summer down under here, the pastel colours are fire. It's not super loud from the front which is nice, just has a super clean look all round. A definite cop for me!  **A-Cold-Wall\* Logo Tee // ¬•98.00 // $16.12 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D638564233808%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.a22ef2b&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=638564233808&spm=1101.1101.N.N.a22ef2b) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/NT2d02i))  Size: M // Colour: black   Looks : 7/10 // Feel: 7/10 // Overall: 7/10   Weight: 264g  Thoughts:   Pretty decent tee for the price. Logo looks good and the patch on the back is fine, I'm not reading it too closely anyway. Pretty heavy feeling and comfy enough.  Fit is good, would recommend going TTS. What more do you need to know? It's a black tee with a logo and some text on it.  **iSecret(?)

I don't think it's a rep, just a random overseas brand, but holy moly this design was simply too cool to pass up. Someone else posted it to this sub (shoutout to whoever it was) and I simply had to cop, it just goes too damn hard. It's quite a large and boxy fit, and the material is nothing too special, but the construction seems pretty good. Also note that the logo isn't embossed, it's part of the artwork. Super cool shirt though, definitely gonna be wearing this one a bit during summer.  **Palace Striped Tee // ¬•90.00 // $14.48 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D638268076103%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.41d6cd2&nTag=Bar-search&from=search-input&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=638268076103&spm=1101.1101.N.N.41d6cd2) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Kw1wvqi))  Size: M // Colour: Green   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 9/10 // Overall: 8/10   Weight: 224g  Thoughts:   Every time I do the laundry, there's like half a clotheshorse of white tees and then another half black tees so it's nice to add some colour variety to the wardrobe. This is a really nice shirt for spring/summer, it's got a nice muted green colour and the fabric is super lightweight, soft and almost stretchy. Feels super comfortable to wear and looks great to. You won't find many better cops for $14.  **ASKYURSELF Lost In Paradise Inside Out Tee // ¬•95.00 // $15.63 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D639292187904%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.7357095&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=639292187904&spm=1101.1101.N.N.7357095) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/nFQqeD1))  Size: S // Colour: Purple Black   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 7/10 // Overall: 7/10   Weight: 283g  Thoughts:   This is a pretty cool tee, it's designed to be inside out, with the graphic printed on what would normally be the inside of the shirt blank. It gives it a pretty urban an rustic feel which is pretty dope. However one thing to note is that it's got a sort of ""dirty"" look to it where there's a dark brown patchiness to it. Personally I like it but it might be a bit of a surprise if you don't know the piece well. The blank feels fine, not spectacular. Bottom line is if you like the piece/design, you'll probably like this otherwise it may not be for you.  &#x200B;  # üëñ Pants üëñ  **Nike Dri-fit DNA Basketball Shorts // ¬•42.00 // $6.42 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fspm%3Da230r.1.999.11.4452523cTFMKPG%26id%3D654923514989%26ns%3D1%23detail&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.999.6.4452523cTFMKPG&id=652355479163&ns=1#detail) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/kNRKfFT))  Size: XL \[165-170cm\] // Colour: 005 black   Looks : 7/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 8/10   Weight: 267g  Thoughts:   Note: original link was dead, but I've found another seller that looks like the same batch/product. Plenty available if you reverse img search. I needed a few more gym shorts, and these looked pretty sick. They're a tad large, and the swoosh is a bit chunky too in-hand, but really nobody is gonna care, especially not at the gym. They're pretty breathable, a really solid pair of shorts for gym or sports.  **Palm Angels Jungle Print Track Pants // ¬•118.00 // $19.67 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D646614767252%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.affd42&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=646614767252&spm=1101.1101.N.N.affd42) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/Ca5R8L5))  Size: S // Colour: pants   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 9/10 // Overall: 9/10   Weight: 481g  Thoughts:   You might have guessed from the last item, but I've been getting more into floral stuff, and this is a super sick design. It's quite a statement piece in an outfit but goes well if you match it with a plain white tee. The quality on these is really nice. They're a bit more lightweight than standard thicker winter sweatpants, but the material is really nice and they feel sleek to wear. They're quite long, but they have a zipper at the heel so you can unzip them a bit to adjust. I'm literally wearing these right now as I'm typing this. The matching jacket is also available if you'd prefer. Probably one of my favourites from the haul.  **Palm Angels Rainbow Stripe Track Pants // ¬•180.00 // $27.37 USD**  (~~WeGoBuy~~ // ~~W2C~~ dead // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/PPi8cyy))  Size: M // Colour: white   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 8/10   Weight: 517g  Thoughts:   Another really cool set of track pants. Same seller as the previous, so they're very similar in quality and build. The colour looks a bit more creamy in-hand that straight white, but I still quite like it. Not really much more to say, refer to the previous item.  **Lacoste Slim Fit Gabardine Chino Dress Pants // ¬•158.00 // $25.99 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fweidian.com%2Fitem.html%3FitemID%3D3370071101&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3370071101) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/8rmP75h))  Size: 30 // Colour: 1x navy, 1x khaki   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 7/10 // Overall: 7/10   Weight: 717g  Thoughts:   Wanted to pick up some more formal style pants for the office, and these ones looked pretty good. They're quite lightweight and very slim-fitting, which means they'll be great for when the weather gets warmer so I won't have to wear shorts to the office and have everyone see my hairy-ass legs. In terms of looks, they're great, they look clean and the Lacoste logos are accurate to retail but small enough that it really doesn't matter how precisely 1:1 they are. The only issue I've had is the button hole is a bit poorly constructed and sometimes leaks fluff and can be hard to jam the button through. Very nice cop for my employed homies.  **Stone Island Shorts // ¬•178.00 // $29.28 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D639109267404%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.14a193f&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=639109267404&spm=1101.1101.N.N.14a193f) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/FFYWmfA))  Size: M // Colour: black   Looks : 4/10 // Feel: 6/10 // Overall: 4/10   Weight: 426g  Thoughts:   These weren't too bad, but a bit disappointing. The bottom of the shorts are really rough, lots of loose threads and just seem generally poorly constructed. The patch actually looks somewhat decent, and they're quite thick and heavy but they just don't look quite as clean as I was hoping. Could be possible that I just got a shit batch, but hey that's life.  **Fear of God Essentials 3M Shorts // ¬•149.00 // $24.51 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D630065069184%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.9ecc683&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=630065069184&spm=1101.1101.N.N.9ecc683) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/QMjdzsX))  Size: M // Colour: Pure white   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 6/10 // Overall: 7/10   Weight: 387g  Thoughts:   Here's the 1 token FOG Essentials item everyone has that you're allowed to skip over if you simply don't care about Essentials stuff. It's a decent pair of shorts, however the fit is a bit boxy (even for FOG stuff). Otherwise decent enough to wear. Probably gonna get more mileage at home than out and about because people gotta wait til marriage to see my bare legs.  &#x200B;  # üëü Shoes üëü  **Nike Blazer Mid Infinite // ¬•310.00 // $48.02 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fweidian.com%2Fitem.html%3FitemID%3D4182786192%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.1ab1d84&nTag=Bar-search&from=search-input&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4182786192&spm=1101.1101.N.N.1baec75) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/ucecvmP))  Size: 44   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 8/10   Weight: 1147g  Thoughts:   Blazers continue to be underrated, and this colourway is dope. I GP'd a few batches as I couldn't seem to find anyone who's copped these before, and it took a few returns/sellers to find one that was accurate. Fortunately, this batch was really nice; the swoosh lines up properly with the back grey panel, the stitching on the back is clean, and the text on the back of the tongue is great too. They're a bit on the tighter size, so sizing up once is a good choice. I did have a couple of minor construction complaints, the coloured panels are coming away from the shoe a little bit and the foam where the tongue is seems a little bit delicate. But really, I'm overstating these by even mentioning them. Definitely would cop again.  **Air Jordan 1 Biohack // ¬•540.00 // $88.82 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy/selfservice/?url=https%3A%2F%2F91sheep.x.yupoo.com%2Falbums%2F88713186%3Fuid%3D1&from=search-input&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C + QC](https://91sheep.x.yupoo.com/albums/88713186?uid=1&referrercate=3392543&spm=1101.1101.N.N.eb2af8c))  Size: US10.5   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 9/10   Weight: 1368g  Thoughts:   Another really cool AJ1 variant that I don't seem to see copped often. The quality is really nice, seems practically flawless to my eyes. The colours are super bold and vivid. It's expensive, but seems pretty much like a retail pair to me at least. They had to be aired out a little when they arrived though 'cause they were a tad funky smelling, but they're comfy to wear and look good on foot. If your bank account can handle it, the quality is worth it.  **Air Jordan 1 Dark Mocha // ¬•540.00 // $88.82 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy/selfservice/?url=https%3A%2F%2F91sheep.x.yupoo.com%2Falbums%2F88717502%3Fuid%3D1&from=search-input&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C + QC](https://91sheep.x.yupoo.com/albums/88717502?uid=1&referrercate=3392543&spm=1101.1101.N.N.ec07b78))  Size: US10.5   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 9/10 // Overall: 8/10   Weight: 1383g  Thoughts:   This is one every repfam should have, it's basically a staple at this point. I personally prefer this design to the TS AJ1s which are the main brown AJ1 competitor. Might be cool to chuck some pink laces on though. Quality is great, fit is snug. Maybe go an extra half size up if your normal size is already a tight fit. The suede looks great, could maybe benefit from a quick brush but mine looked fine. I can't see any real flaws, if I wanted to be pedantic the bottom part of the ""J"" in Jordan is maybe slightly too straight, but *nobody* is seeing that on foot. It's not exactly a budget batch, but it's worth the price IMO.  &#x200B;  # üíé Accessories/Other üíé  **Louis Vuitton Daimer Black Necklace // ¬•78.00 // $12.83 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D639080086151%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.c7b519b&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=639080086151&spm=1101.1101.N.N.c9ec90e) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/fj7dko6))  Size: n/a // Colour: silver   Looks : 9/10 // Feel: 9/10 // Overall: 9/10   Weight: 142g  Thoughts:   This is a pretty cool necklace which doesn't have LV's usual super loud style, so if you're more into subtle accessories this is a necklace for you. It's shiny, the engraving is super clean on both the tags and the top part of the chain. Good length for me, and easy to take on and take off. Great cop for a pretty cheap price.  **FOG Essentials Waterproof Backpack // ¬•129.99 // $21.04 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D613702705360%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.d9b9478&nTag=Bar-search&from=search-input&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=613702705360&spm=1101.1101.N.N.d9b9478) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/HRu9hpd))  Size: n/a // Colour: black   Looks : 7/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 7/10   Weight: 816g  Thoughts:   My other backpack was falling apart, so I needed something I could take to work, uni, and whatnot. The material it's made out of is nothing special, but it does seem to be waterproof and reasonably sturdy. The zippers are a bit temperamental and get jammed occasionally, but other than that seems fine. Doesn't have anywhere to put a drink bottle which kinda sucks but what can you do, buy something else if that's what you need I guess.  **Unbranded Silver Necklace // ¬•18.00 // $2.96 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?nTag=Home-search&from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D536822486099&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=536822486099) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/IhYYAwS))  Size: 5mm medium chain length 60cm // Colour: Steel   Looks : 8/10 // Feel: 8/10 // Overall: 8/10   Weight: 26g  Thoughts:   Not really a rep, but just wanted a chain in this style to use in some outfits. Quality is fine, and it looks decent enough, as expected. Really not much to say about this one, but for less than a cup of expensive Australian coffee, this is a great value cop.  **Unbranded Retro Octagon Sunglasses // ¬•22.00 // $3.62 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D565495831346%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.9ef2e37&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=565495831346&spm=1101.1101.N.N.9ef2e37) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/iN80DV3))  Size: n/a // Colour: Silver Frame light pink   Looks : 5/10 // Feel: 6/10 // Overall: 5/10   Weight: 44g  Thoughts:   Again, this was another item where I just knew what style I wanted and found a random item to match. They're a bit bigger than I was expecting in hand, they look quite large on the face. In terms of quality, it's okay at best, the black paint on the temple tips seems to come off pretty easily ‚Äì they've only been worn a couple of times and there's already some visible parts where the paint is coming off. There's a couple of different colour options on the listing if you don't want to rock the pink. I believe there's some options for prescription lenses available, but not sure I'd trust $3 prescription lenses.  **Squirtle Sunglasses // ¬•25.00 // $4.17 USD**  ([WeGoBuy](https://www.wegobuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdetail.tmall.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D632862619279%26spm%3D1101.1101.N.N.a6a4227%26sku_properties%3D134942334%3A28315&partnercode=w949NG) // [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=632862619279&spm=1101.1101.N.N.a6a4227) // [QC](https://imgur.com/a/LSLQ8Z5))  Size: n/a // Colour: black   Looks : 4/10 // Feel: 3/10 // Overall: 3/10   Weight: 59g  Thoughts:   Saw the post in this sub, and had to get the [squirtle drip](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/ldee9p/squirtle_squad_sunglasses_w_retail_for_comparison/). Great for a meme, but in hand they're really not all that impressive. Had to return the first pair since they showed up at the warehouse mega scratched, and second pair was better but still arrived looking worse for wear. They're made out of a cheap plastic (not glass obviously) and feel quite tacky. Might just be me, but they don't sit on my nose very well either and slide off. They're a funny thing to whip out in front of friends, but other than that can't really recommend. Not even for $4.  &#x200B;  \*\*\*  # FINAL THOUGHTS  I now have *way* too many t-shirts.  My future hauls are probably gonna involve fewer tees now, and hopefully more long sleeves, pants, jackets and accessories. Seriously, the tee shelf in my wardrobe is stacked to the brim. Fortunately it means I don't have to do laundry all that often anymore.  But all in all, this haul was really a success, there were pretty much no items that were an L and the quality all round was great. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading, I appreciate you guys.

I started helping some guy that lost his phone and let him use mine to find it and we had a gang. The crazy thing about this is that I go to college in NY and was visiting a friend in Ohio.

Thick double layer fabric with a smooth and silky texture, perfect bagginess and drop shoulder, with a tight waistband that hugs your body just right. I‚Äôm getting bricked up right now just thinking about wearing it. I bought the gray one in the first half of this haul, and liked it so much I had to buy another. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever buy blank hoodies from anywhere else. Looks exactly like double layer hoodie that [mnml sells](https://imgur.com/a/JgG2mdH), I think they might share the same supplier.  &#x200B;  # ERL Hoodie  [ Size: M - Length 65 cm | Chest 66 cm | Shoulder 64 cm| Sleeve 61 cm](https://i.redd.it/caej78q7imia1.gif)  [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4408789829&spider_token=4572) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=BED3B4AC52AE41D1030385EE057F270F) | Weight: 972g | Ôø•270 / $42  Rating: 8/10  I knew what I was getting into when I bought it, but this is really a colorful ass hoodie. I usually shy away from bright colors, but I like the design. Has solid construction, no loose threads, and it isn‚Äôt a thin, cheap feeling blank. My only complaint is that it‚Äôs a little too baggy on me, I maybe could‚Äôve gotten away with a size small instead.  &#x200B;  # Chrome Hearts Jacket  [ Size: S - Length 69 cm | Chest 59 cm | Shoulder 50 | Sleeve 63 cm](https://i.redd.it/kngyo7dcimia1.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=686356145909) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=7690ACA4FD5636C59367138B04FAA730) | Weight: 772g | Ôø•140 / $22  Rating: 7/10  Needed simple black jacket that could be dressed up and down and this was an almost perfect fit. Had to get it tailored a bit and fix the uneven pocket. You can see in the photo that one pocket is higher than the other. I'd say the quality is alright, but the buttons rattle a little bit. Link died before writing the review, but I linked another seller that sells the same jacket.  &#x200B;  # Stussy 8 Ball Sherpa  [ Size: M - Length 66 cm | Chest 61 cm | Shoulder 51 | Sleeve 61 cm](https://i.redd.it/yrnov2yfimia1.gif)  [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=5794961038&spider_token=4572) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=AA2A4E9FA8E07599B5E52FCA4E6488DC) | Weight: 885g | Ôø•158 / $25  Rating: 9/10  You‚Äôve probably seen it before on this sub, or already own it. Nice and toasty in the winter, not much else to say. It‚Äôs reversible, but I usually wear it on the boring side with the sherpa inside.  &#x200B;  # Stussy Green Sherpa  [ Size: S - Length 65.5 cm | Chest 56 cm | Shoulder 49 | Sleeve 62 cm](https://i.redd.it/zk66t28iimia1.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=691961301716) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=53A694E82926C428EB9BF7621FF0C969) | Weight: 814g | Ôø•291 / $45  Rating: 9.5/10  I like this jacket more than the 8 ball sherpa, but it drives me crazy how the pocket on this jacket is crooked at the top. Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a batch flaw or if I just got unlucky. It‚Äôs also reversible, but I wear this one with the sherpa out only. Link died, the W2C is a different more expensive batch (398 yuan).  &#x200B;  # Saint Laurent Teddy Jacket  [ Size: L \(50\) - Length 63 cm | Chest 60 cm | Shoulder 49 | Sleeve 66 cm](https://i.redd.it/l01pc52limia1.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=678396882323) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=01048C12A68A1156C08D7A220CFC208E) | Weight: 1257g | Ôø•339 / $53  Rating: 5/10  Being generous, I would say this is a slightly above garbage tier slp teddy jacket. It has a nice weight to it, but that's really the only thing it has going for it. The cream leather shoulder strips are made of paper thin ""leather"" that buckles up weirdly, and have some weird blue speckles on it. The waist band also isn‚Äôt as tight as the retail should be.  &#x200B;  # Deep End 22FW Puffer Jacket  [ Size: L - Length 60.5 cm | Chest 62 cm | Shoulder 56 | Sleeve 62 cm](https://i.redd.it/98u8c4enimia1.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=691665154311) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=1FC720FE1837BB5AB78410449FC5290C) | Weight: 647g | Ôø•499 / $77  Rating: 8/10  This bomber jacket is one of the pieces I was looking forward to the most, but the second I took it out of the box I was slightly disappointed tbh. I was expecting a heavier jacket to wear in this cold winter, but this is more of a light spring jacket. The weight makes it very obvious, but I didn‚Äôt notice. Has nice looking zippered pockets in front, but unfortunately, they‚Äôre placed in a way that would make you look like an idiot with your hands in them. I wish the zipper around the collar had a pocket with a hood inside of it, that would've been a nice design touch. It‚Äôs a little pricey for what it is, but I don‚Äôt regret buying it.  &#x200B;  # Zara B3 Bomber Jacket  [ Size: S - Length 64 cm | Chest 62 cm | Shoulder 52.5 | Sleeve 64 cm](https://i.redd.it/4qm3h13qimia1.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=632731321555) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=A1FE365E350AD8A3C2B95AD4B105B3D5) | Weight: 1299g | Ôø•249 / $39  Rating: 10/10  Nice and warm dressy winter coat, at an affordable price. Perfect length for me, fits exactly how I wanted, my only complaint is that the pockets on this jacket are also super high. Found out the hard way that this jacket will shed a lot for the first few times you wear it, which looks especially bad if you happen to be wearing black underneath and don‚Äôt own a lint roller.  &#x200B;  **BOTTOMS**  &#x200B;  # Vuja De Pleated Lounge Pants  [ Size: S - Length 105 cm | Waist Circumference 64 - 86 cm | Thigh 29 cm | Inseam 76 cm | Leg Opening 23 cm](https://i.redd.it/y6jtd5ktimia1.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=643330961709) | [QC Pics (Gray)](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=20635EC1D1D0BA14295B90ECE4F6B11B) | [QC Pics (Black)](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=A8839AE79949C53B3DDA6D7CF0BC55AF) | Weight: 777g | Ôø•169 / $26  Rating: 10/10  These sweats have a nice weight to them, the material has a nice feel to it, and they fall nicely on shoes too. Definitely worth the price. They‚Äôre a little snug on the quads, and mine aren‚Äôt big, so if you have tree trunk legs I‚Äôd consider sizing up once.  &#x200B;  # Carhartt Double Knee Pants  [ Size: S - Length 104 cm | Waist Circumference 76 cm | Thigh 31.5 cm | Inseam 76.5 cm | Leg Opening 21 cm](https://i.redd.it/7cxpc0svimia1.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=686760043502) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=2072C80E2AAD278675F83E01DFF71612) | Weight: 674g | Ôø•135 / $21  Rating: 9/10  Simple pair of regular fit carpenter pants, quality construction if you overlook the janky ass stitching on the carhartt tag. It‚Äôs started fading pretty nicely already.  &#x200B;  # Chrome Hearts Double Knee Pants  [ Size: S - Length 102 cm | Waist Circumference 78 cm | Thigh 32 cm | Inseam 72 cm | Leg Opening 20 cm](https://i.redd.it/ianfboyximia1.gif)  [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=5036771807&spider_token=4572) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=0DFECC2DAE11D6086351D4D43ADEDFDB) | Weight: 794g | Ôø•148 / $23  Rating: 7/10  These are honestly a great pair of pants so I won‚Äôt rate them too harshly, but they just fit weird on me at the bottom, I don‚Äôt like how they fall on my shoes. The major flaw on these is that compared to retail they‚Äôre missing some of the rivets on the front. I found a seller that sells them, but they‚Äôre [slightly smaller](https://imgur.com/a/kJ880R6).  &#x200B;  # Far Archive Curve Mix Pants  [ Size: S - Length 104 cm | Waist Circumference 74 - 88 cm | Thigh 29.5 cm | Inseam 78 cm | Leg Opening 20.5 cm](https://i.redd.it/ex6l6de0jmia1.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=675780870091) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=323ABB53F77D86BD0C7419071C4A9BCE) | Weight: 467g | Ôø•199 / $31  Rating: 8/10  Interesting looking track pants, but a little disappointing, cause I was hoping they‚Äôd be a little thicker. Not really winter appropriate unless you layer with some thermals. These are slimmer fitting than the carpenter pants with a small flare at the bottom.  &#x200B;  **SHOES**  &#x200B;  # Dr. Martens 1461 Bex  [mid](https://i.redd.it/2xooe9j2jmia1.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=671900715662) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=668260631B666F1D7F87CBAB909459E0) | Weight: 1275g | Ôø•168 / $26  Rating: 4/10  Mediocre is the word of the day, because that is exactly what these are. The shape is way off, making them look like clown shoes unlike the retails I tried on. The outsole feels flimsy, and the insoles make this weird sticky noise when you lift your foot. Never leaving the house with these on, I wouldn‚Äôt even cut grass in them. For $26 you get what you pay for unsurprisingly.  &#x200B;  # Bred 4s  [G Batch](https://i.redd.it/3u2pi884jmia1.gif)  [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4773089956&spider_token=4572) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=74DD06BA769A14D1D483509C2126967D) | Weight: 1129g | Ôø•249 / $38  Rating: 8/10  This was a bit of an impulse buy, cause I was never really a fan of these, but they grew on me all of a sudden. Nubuck is good, cages good, tongue is off, and the stitching under the wings is off, so not a perfect rep by any means, but a good buy imo if you don‚Äôt care about perfection.  &#x200B;  # Yeezy Season 4 Combat Boot  https://i.redd.it/dyy9yef5jmia1.gif  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=573418977427) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=B92C062C6CB3C133C62B9F9072DC1DA9) | Weight: 1622g | Ôø•428 / $66  Rating: 9/10  haven‚Äôt worn these out yet. Bought them to experiment a bit cause I haven‚Äôt owned any boots in years, especially not any jrotc looking boots. The silhouette on this boot is fire imo, and the construction is pretty solid so I‚Äôd say I got my money‚Äôs worth. No idea how accurate to retail though. My only complaint is that the insoles slide up a bit when you take the boots off, which is fixable with a little glue. Had to exchange these because the seller said to size down‚Äîdon‚Äôt listen to the description these are 100% true to size.  &#x200B;  # Stussy AF1  [ üòà](https://i.redd.it/roaqxvr6jmia1.gif)  [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4164209349&spider_token=4572) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=10C27CAE9DC5EDADCC9CA805DD689EBE) | Weight: 918g | Ôø•180 / $28  Rating: 7/10  Had to exchange these at the warehouse because the heel tabs were crooked the first time, and guess what, the second pair was crooked too, go figure. QC is not too great on these, but the leather around ankle and on the tongue feels like heaven when you slip your feet in these.  &#x200B;  **MISC**  &#x200B;  # Chrome Hearts Bracelet  [18 cm](https://i.redd.it/8cq2vwlajmia1.gif)  [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6057547004) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=0099186552F81A800B6F01D26300599B) | Weight: 88g | Ôø•275 / $42  Rating: 9/10  This is my second time buying this bracelet. I bought it cheaper from another seller but it fell off my wrist cause the clasp was garbage. This clasp on this one is a little better, but I think all it‚Äôll take is one drunk night and this one will be gone too, so be careful with this one if you buy it.  &#x200B;  # Rep Costco Card  https://i.redd.it/8e6h86pbjmia1.gif  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=582158025867) | Weight: 38g | Ôø•17 / $3  Rating: 10/10  Wanted to mooch off my parents‚Äô Costco membership and they maxed out the amount of members they can have, so I went to my favorite Chinese website to find a seller who could print a cheap copy for me. Got 5 cards printed for about $3.  &#x200B;  # Urban Sophistication Puffer Case  https://i.redd.it/scp51f1djmia1.gif  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=661304328453) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=DE261D6CFA5F0F40552E250D2732EF30) | Weight: 36g | Ôø•40 / $6  Rating: 10/10  Had to cop a lil puffer jacket for the phone in these cold, trying times. Adds a little bulk to your phone, but it feels as soft as it looks. Thanksgiving isn‚Äôt any time soon, but I‚Äôm thankful for all the ~~suckers~~ wonderful people who paid $60+ dollars for this retail so that I could buy it for $6.  &#x200B;  That's it for the reviews, but here are some other items that were bought for other people or items I didn't feel like reviewing:  [Imgur Link](https://imgur.com/a/wMykl1X)  &#x200B;  **PandaBuy Review**  Pandabuy has locked me in as a repeat customer, and I will continue to give them all of my hard earned money. This time around I didn't have any major problems with PandaBuy's service.

"LV,Dior","haul,trends","Can anyone relate? To make a long story slightly shorter, I'm very new to this replica fashion game. I've always admired streetwear and its trends from a distance, but never felt that it was worth shelling out hundreds if not thousands of dollars for a box logo on a T-shirt.   As I discover more and more on this sub, I can't help but realize the amount of people that are scared of what some hypothetical spoiled 12 year old hypebeast out there thinks about the stitching pattern on your Off White AJ1 reps.   If anything, I'm more scared of getting robbed, and I think that's what's making me hesitate at the trigger of buying the hype releases I've always appreciated.   Maybe it's just where I'm from, but I've heard multiple tales from classmates and friends who were robbed for their Jordans when they went out to show off their new cop.  This is why I think I'll take a more ""if you know, you know"" low-key fashion approach from my first haul: Since I do want to overhaul my wardrobe and step my fashion game up, but don't want to make myself a walking target in the process.  So I won't be rocking a LV x Supreme Bogo Hoodie rep with some Chrome Hearts Denim Jean Fugazi's on top of some Air Dior 1's with a Fraudemar on the wrist anytime soon (for now), but I'll see where this rabbit hole goes.  But can anyone relate to these concerns? and if so, how has it impacted your rep choices?;;Robbed? Where tf do u live man?","{upvote:5,timestamp:2020-05-17}",Reddit,1,0

My only complaint is that it‚Äôs a little too baggy on me, I maybe could‚Äôve gotten away with a size small instead.  &#x200B;  # Chrome Hearts Jacket  [ Size: S - Length 69 cm | Chest 59 cm | Shoulder 50 | Sleeve 63 cm](https://i.redd.it/kngyo7dcimia1.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=686356145909) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=7690ACA4FD5636C59367138B04FAA730) | Weight: 772g | Ôø•140 / $22  Rating: 7/10  Needed simple black jacket that could be dressed up and down and this was an almost perfect fit. Had to get it tailored a bit and fix the uneven pocket. You can see in the photo that one pocket is higher than the other. I'd say the quality is alright, but the buttons rattle a little bit.

Nice and toasty in the winter, not much else to say.

Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a batch flaw or if I just got unlucky. It‚Äôs also reversible, but I wear this one with the sherpa out only.

It has a nice weight to it, but that's really the only thing it has going for it. The cream leather shoulder strips are made of paper thin ""leather"" that buckles up weirdly, and have some weird blue speckles on it. The waist band also isn‚Äôt as tight as the retail should be.  &#x200B;  # Deep End 22FW Puffer Jacket  [ Size: L - Length 60.5 cm | Chest 62 cm | Shoulder 56 | Sleeve 62 cm](https://i.redd.it/98u8c4enimia1.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=691665154311) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=1FC720FE1837BB5AB78410449FC5290C) | Weight: 647g | Ôø•499 / $77  Rating: 8/10  This bomber jacket is one of the pieces I was looking forward to the most, but the second I took it out of the box I was slightly disappointed tbh. I was expecting a heavier jacket to wear in this cold winter, but this is more of a light spring jacket. The weight makes it very obvious, but I didn‚Äôt notice. Has nice looking zippered pockets in front, but unfortunately, they‚Äôre placed in a way that would make you look like an idiot with your hands in them. I wish the zipper around the collar had a pocket with a hood inside of it, that would've been a nice design touch. It‚Äôs a little pricey for what it is, but I don‚Äôt regret buying it.  &#x200B;  # Zara B3 Bomber Jacket  [ Size: S - Length 64 cm | Chest 62 cm | Shoulder 52.5 | Sleeve 64 cm](https://i.redd.it/4qm3h13qimia1.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=632731321555) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=A1FE365E350AD8A3C2B95AD4B105B3D5) | Weight: 1299g | Ôø•249 / $39  Rating: 10/10  Nice and warm dressy winter coat, at an affordable price. Perfect length for me, fits exactly how I wanted, my only complaint is that the pockets on this jacket are also super high. Found out the hard way that this jacket will shed a lot for the first few times you wear it, which looks especially bad if you happen to be wearing black underneath and don‚Äôt own a lint roller.  &#x200B;  **BOTTOMS**  &#x200B;  # Vuja De Pleated Lounge Pants  [ Size: S - Length 105 cm | Waist Circumference 64 - 86 cm | Thigh 29 cm | Inseam 76 cm | Leg Opening 23 cm](https://i.redd.it/y6jtd5ktimia1.gif)  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=643330961709) | [QC Pics (Gray)](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=20635EC1D1D0BA14295B90ECE4F6B11B) | [QC Pics (Black)](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=A8839AE79949C53B3DDA6D7CF0BC55AF) | Weight: 777g | Ôø•169 / $26  Rating: 10/10  These sweats have a nice weight to them, the material has a nice feel to it, and they fall nicely on shoes too.

The major flaw on these is that compared to retail they‚Äôre missing some of the rivets on the front.

The shape is way off, making them look like clown shoes unlike the retails I tried on. The outsole feels flimsy, and the insoles make this weird sticky noise when you lift your foot. Never leaving the house with these on, I wouldn‚Äôt even cut grass in them.

Bought them to experiment a bit cause I haven‚Äôt owned any boots in years, especially not any jrotc looking boots. The silhouette on this boot is fire imo, and the construction is pretty solid so I‚Äôd say I got my money‚Äôs worth. No idea how accurate to retail though. My only complaint is that the insoles slide up a bit when you take the boots off, which is fixable with a little glue. Had to exchange these because the seller said to size down‚Äîdon‚Äôt listen to the description these are 100% true to size.  &#x200B;  # Stussy AF1  [ üòà](https://i.redd.it/roaqxvr6jmia1.gif)  [W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4164209349&spider_token=4572) | [QC Pics](https://www.pandabuy.com/share?key=10C27CAE9DC5EDADCC9CA805DD689EBE) | Weight: 918g | Ôø•180 / $28  Rating: 7/10  Had to exchange these at the warehouse because the heel tabs were crooked the first time, and guess what, the second pair was crooked too, go figure.

I don‚Äôt mind spending 100 ish USD on a piece of the quality is good but I often don‚Äôt find reps of lowkey clothing. Do you guys have any sellers/products you recommend?;;Check out r/DesignerReps if you haven't already. Most of the same sellers that carry the high tier reps of the ""loud"" pieces also have plenty of quiet luxury items from the same brands. You just don't see them reviewed or QC'd because those aren't the items most sub members buy. Look through posts of high tier reps of the brands you want, then click over to the Yupoo site or whatever URL is given for the seller, and you will usually see plenty of low-key pieces. By the way, no rep clothing pieces, with the exception of a few high end coats and jackets, should cost $100 USD. 350-450 yuan is much more common as a price range for the high tier reps of sweaters and button-down shirts, and tees are normally under 300 yuan.

Unlike the Nike, are not tapered, but they're like a third of the price. Loose threads on the inside, but stripe stitching seems fine. Pockets are tiny so I'm pretty scared to put keys or my phone in them lol. I'm gonna be wearing these at home/to run errands but if anyone calls you out on these make them blow you.  * ASSC hoodie is the perfect size for me, a little bigger than the Champion hoodie. Cuffing seems a bit thin, but everything else is thick and heavy. Only caveat is that this hoodie doesn't have that much ""stretch"". Considering that my back/shoulders are a lot bigger than my waist, holding my hands straight out and touching them together kinda strains? the hoodie against my back. However, I'm not clapping all the time everyday. Hood is a bit small, but that may be because of my big ass head. Not wearing the hood even if it rains. Don't have retail, but am pretty sure text on back is too small. Don't really care though, and I can always layer with a windbreaker if need be. Drawstrings are also too long. I'm leaving them but you can just pull them out.   * Champion hoodie is a tiny bit smaller, but fits snugly. Hood isn't super ""tall"" but it's super deep, so when I put the hood on it extends past my face, but it also makes the rest of the hoodie rise up, if that makes sense. Also won't be putting the hood on. Material feels a bit silkier than the ASSC hoodie, stretchy and is elasticky? unlike the ASSC hoodie, which is nice. Stitching is pretty clean, both on front and arm. The front pouch is *fucking tiny* ** however. You can kinda see how small in my fitpic. Also don't know if retail has that little patch on the pouch.  * These joggers are recommended so often and I can see why. Material is soft and silky, pockets are nice and deep. Logo looks fine since I got the black one. drawstring is nice and thicc. I have tiny calves compared to the rest of my body, and while fit pretty snugly on quads/hamstrings, the calf sections and cuffs are fucking tight. I prefer it like this, but thicc bois may want to size up so their calves don't suffocate.  * Anthea's Vans were an absolute fuckfest. I ordered Old Skools in (Black 40) (Blue 43) (Black 42) and Checkered Slip Ons in (42). I had mentioned to my agent to only accept Vans batches, and not Vansget. Submitted order February 20, got the shoes March 10. Size 40 was the wrong size, size 42 had shitty stitching, and size 43 was the wrong color. Checkered vans looked like the Vans Vault Checkered Slip ons, not the regular Checkered slip ons that were posted on the item description page. The wrong size and wrong color shoes were sent back to be replaced, and I tried to get the Vans with shitty stitching to be replaced to, but was denied so kept it. I also tried exchanging the checkered Vans, but was denied twice. I contacted Anthea through Aliwangwang, and found out that Anthea had either: correct checkered with black trim (vansget) or incorrect checkered with white trim (vans). Since I had asked for Vans, he just went ahead and gave me the defect version. I was working it out with him, to exchange for a pair of checkered old skools instead. However, I coincidentally found out then that there was a model called the Vans Vault checkerboard that had the white trim, so it wasn't a RL. I decided to keep the checkers. The Size 43 Blues and Size 40 Blacks came. I didn't get the detailed photo service, so it turns out the blue old skools had the red vans tag placed on backwards, hence the faded logo, the result of my friend sanding them down lol. The rest of the red Vans tags are a bit crooked. Other than all that shit, stitching is a little messy, and glue marks everywhere, but not too noticeable and would cop again since these are basically $20 vans when shipping is accounted for.  * Don't know about 1:1 since don't have retail 40oz HF. Can't really be 1:1 anyways, since this gradient doesn't exist. Insulated really fucking well. Filled it about 1/4 with ice, and majority of it was still there 17 hours later. Straw is too long to fit in bottle, so I cut it. Won't be using it anyways, since I slapped a takeya lid on it. Asked seller if they used lead based paint, they said no. I used a lead swab kit, seemed fine. I'm gonna go ahead and use it. If I die, so be it.  * Duffel bag is one of the smaller ones, perfect for the gym but too small for something like a camping trip. One top compartment, one side compartment. Came with two shoulder straps for some reason, but nothing to bind the two hand straps together.   * Rise shirt is *silky* smooth. Feels like cheaper dri-fit? Sleeves are a bit too long for my liking, but I can just bunch them up. Can't speak for the 1:1ness of this, but hardly anyone has heard of this gym apparel brand.  * I believe the Fuegnt tag is incorrect. Everything else looks good. Not super thin, so its not only a layering piece, but its a little big/wide me for me if I just wear it with a tee. Fits perfectly over a hoodie or something. If someone tries to LC your collar tag make them blow you.  * ###Items that don't have fitpics/randoms pics/takeaways are either because they are my friend's items or because they're not clothes.  ##P.s. Dan if you see this I love you thanks for loaning me $40 because I didn't account for rape shipping;;Heart broken üíî good luck with that 1:1 girlfriend ","{upvote:19,timestamp:2019-03-27}",Reddit,1,0

Fits perfect. Go with your size  Looks: 10/10  Quality: 10/10  Comfort: 8/10. It is nice but I am a huge Yeezy fan lol.  I am incredibly impressed by this pair. I was nervous after seeing the QC because the color looked too yellow, but it must be PB lighting. After watching LC videos and comparisons, the only things I can find that are off are small details such as the feeling of the sticker in the box and the number of stitches on the back of the shoe. Suede looks great to me. My video shows how it reacts to touch. No way of knowing these are reps without inspecting the box or MAYBE if it's next to a real pair.

The color is pretty yellow in person. Unlike retail, the bottom of this shirt was hemmed. In my in-hand pictures, you can see what it looks like after I cut just above the hem. The fit is a little off compared to retail. Retail has more of a boxy fit compared to this shirt. Disappointed in the sizing printing, as it was sewn into the collar. Puff print is amazing afaik.

No complaints about this jacket whatsoever. It is super high quality, especially the KSG picture on the back. The stitching of the picture is very good, maybe even better than retail.

The length is slightly shorter than most tees, but it fits nice.  Looks: 9/10  Quality: 8/10  Comfort: 7/10  The text is much lighter than the authentic shirt. The most important part of this tee is the print, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. There are slight glue marks on the bottom of the shirt. Pandabuy made me aware of this, but I decided it was a minor issue. The size tag seems accurate, but there is no size listed on the shirt. The material of the shirt is super thick. It feels decently heavy, but it is rigid, making it slightly uncomfortable. Great simple shirt for a very cheap price.

Runs slightly smaller than most XLs. I would go TTS. Size up if between sizes.  Looks: 8/10  Quality: 7/10  Comfort: 6/10  The graphics on the shirt appear to be ""blurry"" for lack of better words. There is also an oil stain at the top of the shirt, on the cacti branding. Pandabuy once again made me aware of this. I realize this is a very cheap shirt, but I am disappointed that both of my shirts from FLANEUR ATELIER have stains. Once again it is wearable, but it is disappointing. Also, the size on the size tag is not included, just like the BLONDED shirt. I am unsure what the reasoning for this is. Maybe to not be able to resale? I feel I got exactly what I paid for with this shirt. Decent quality with pretty cool branding. Sadly this shirt is no longer on sale for those interested. It may be somewhere on FLANEUR's site.

Looks cheap. They are.  Quality: Pendant: 8/10 Chain: 5/10. Expected for a $5 necklace  I bought these necklaces knowing the quality would be low. The silver necklace is different from the listing pictures. There are colorful bits in the silver pendant, whereas the listing was meant to look more diamond-like. Pieces of the silver chain broke off after only one day of wear. I did not do anything excessive, it just slipped out one of the rings and fell off. I did get many compliments from these. They fit pretty tight, especially the silver now that it is shorter. Very close to choker length. These are pretty cool pieces, but alternatives could likely be found on Etsy or even your local mall.

Wayyyy too small. If I were to buy again I would probably go 2 sizes up to an XXL.  Looks: 9/10. Points taken off for misspellings on pocket.  Quality: 8/10  Fair warning to anyone copping, these have ZERO stretching ability. These were too tight, especially around thigh areas and even length. I attempted many methods to stretch these out, to no avail. And no, I will not show the fit. These feel great in hand though, so I may consider buying again in the future. On both pants, the small print on the pocket has some errors on it (see in hand). It reads ""EAS Y FITTING ANO LASTING VALUE"". The inside feels fairly warm. These would be great for the fall.

It arrived the day after I shipped out the haul. It looks pretty great from QC pics and I can't wait to have them in person.   # KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM MY FIRST HAUL  * Be aware of when carriers ship out. It only adds more waiting if you submit the parcel days before they actually ship out. * Pay attention to measurements on QC. I probably could've known the pants were too small if I would have looked at the length.  * Check spelling closely on all items. * Do not buy something just to fill space in your haul. Even wasting $5 is still wasting. The money could be used for something better or a later haul. * Pandabuy is the goat. * Popular sellers such as chaosmade and Fleneur can be very hit or miss. Products are cheap because they likely produce them cheaply and quickly. * Buying reps is fun! * The sub and discord reviews/ QCs are your best friend.  I had so much fun with my first haul. Although it was not a perfect process or outcome, I am still satisfied with how it went. I hope I could provide some insight for your future hauls. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to message me or post in the comments!  **I WILL RETURN IN FALL/WINTER 2022**;;Very nice detailed review and your haul is pretty unique quite a few shirts I haven't seen before in this sub.

Why?   The overall material is so smooth and soft, even better than most retail sweatshirts I have.   The accuracy is up there to, placement and printing is accurate, comparing with retails online (I don't have retails in hand otherwise I'd do a comparison)   PS: Length of this sweatshirt is crazy long, so i sized down (Refer to the size chart in the store)     **Overall:**   Both pieces are a must cop from me, if you are into the brands.    The quality of both shirts are the best I have ever gotten from any seller.   Moreover, this review is much more focused on BlackCatStudio, he is one of the best sellers that I have ever purchased from in my opinion, (tonysneaker(ogtony), nina, willsneakers, and blackcatstudio are at the top on my list right now), he is patient and took the time to provide QC photos when I requested through WeChat.   His wechat response time is fast, communication was super clear and his prices are f\*\*king reasonable as well.   I will definitely purchase from him again if he ever drops the shirts/hoodies I'm looking at.

"LV,Hermes","quality,price,haul","My Collection/Detailed Review (Part 6) Height: 5‚Äô9 / 175cm  Weight: 175lb / 74 kg / 9 Hauls  Size in Pants: Medium or 32/30  Build: Big Back, Chicken Legs  Disclosure: A lot of these products are going to get very good ratings based on the use I am able to get out of them, I will try to remain as objective as possible though. As always I have next to no clue on how to QC anything but I do notice big flaws.   Thank you for joining me on this journey, this is among the last of my posts as I have covered most of my collection and I have no hauls incoming or being planned for that matter. I do have one more review of footwear and maybe an outfit breakdown if the demand is there for it.  The support for these has been great and in case I don't upload another review I truly appreciate the support. I have seen the community begin to engage in more video reviews/detailed reviews as well which is honestly all I hoped for.  &#x200B;  Off White Shoulder Bag: [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=615225918348)  Looks: 10/10 - Feel: 10/10 - Value 10/10 - Overall: 10/10  You can surprisingly fit a lot of stuff into this tiny bag. I've traveled with this bag and it's really good for what it is. Phone, Wallet, 10,000mah Power Bank and Cables. Best thing about it, there was still room, this bag has 2 sections via a fabric divider on the inside that I regret not including, my apologies for that. The strap does have a flaw but it doesn't affect me in the slightest, it shouldn't affect you either :)    &#x200B;  Hermes AirTag Holder: [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=644208907696)  Looks: 8/10 - Feel: 10/10 - Value 10/10 - Overall: 9.3/10  Because why not? I needed something nicer than the hard plastic AirTag Holder's so I bought 2 of these. They may not have the branding on the back but they do feel like nice quality ""leather"". They look better on my keychain than the hard plastic ones as well, I'll put the second one on my dogs collar because he's the best boy.  &#x200B;  Alexander McQueen Silk Scarf: [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=630595403455)  Looks: 6/10 - Feel: 10/10 - Value 10/10 - Overall: 8.6/10  I don't see much Alexander McQueen stuff on this sub other than the Oversized Sole Sneakers everyone buys from Koala for some reason, I have a budget pair that look like retails. Anyways, this scarf has the right print, it's only missing the ""Alexander McQueen"" on the bottom right of the scarf. It feels like silk but I doubt it is, it'll do what I need it to do. I do believe there are scarves with the proper logo on the bottom right out there, this one was just the cheapest one I could find. I'll GP the pricier ones in my next haul and update you guys whenever that may be.   &#x200B;  Supreme Metro Card Stickers: [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=593951553032)  Looks: 10/10 - Feel: 10/10 - Value 10/10 - Overall: 10/10  These are an interesting piece. When I ordered I thought they were actual Metro Card replicas. On a technicality they are I guess but they ended up working out better than I thought. They're stickers! I figured I'd attach them to the front of an actual metro card and rock out from there, maybe they fit maybe they don't. I'll post a mini update on those sometime soon. They have a nice grainy texture to them as well, I believe it shows on the pictures. For sure going to get use out of them. Can't beat it for the price. Since the posts I found these under did mislead me, I'd just like to make sure it is known that these are STICKERS and not actual Metro Cards.  &#x200B;  White LV Monogram Card Holder: [W2C](https://www.fashionrepsfam.ru/bags-20ht09040?sort=p.price&order=ASC)   Looks: 10/10 - Feel: 10/10 - Value 10/10 - Overall: 10  One of the better products that I've purchased from BrotherSam. I cannot say the same for the other wallet that will be in next week's video. It is to my understanding that everything is where it needs to be on this wallet and I love it as it is. It gets the job done, took about 3 Weeks to arrive from Order Placed. (Copied From Previous Review)   &#x200B;  Black LV Card Holder: [W2C](https://www.fashionrepsfam.ru/bags-20ht09040)   Looks: 0/10 - Feel: 0/10 - Value 0/10 - Overall: 0/10  At first it started off just as good as the previous wallet. However something about the inner fabric is just messed up that it melted from the inside and got stuck to the strip side of my cards. Sticky material would end up on my cards every time I would put them back in or take them out. Completely ruined the wallet. Especially concerning because this was only from normal use.   &#x200B;  Reversible Damier Print Belt: [W2C](https://www.fashionrepsfam.ru/index.php?route=product/product&path=158_159&product_id=11220&sort=p.price&order=DESC)   Looks: 10/10 - Feel: 10/10 - Value 10/10 - Overall: 10  This is a great product, does what I need it to do. Isn't too flashy, the buckle is a bit big though, it digs into my stomach when I sit down. The leather feels nice and carries a nice texture. I was completely unaware that it came with a hole punch so I ruined the belt by using my knife to open a new hole on the belt. The box is terrible but everything else about the product and documentation seem to be in order. Honestly though the box being bad shouldn't affect your decision on accessories in my opinion. I do apologize for the lack of all items included with the wallet, I lost them along the way somewhere. They were all identical to everything included inside the White Wallets box, however I didn't want to mislead and use those for this item as well.   &#x200B;  Box Breakdowns:  White LV Wallet Box Looks: 8/10 - Feel: 10/10 - ""Passability"" 10/10 - Overall: 10/10 Black LV Wallet Box Looks: 6/10 - Feel: 5/10 - ""Passability"" 6/10 - Overall: 5.5/10 Reversible LV Belt Box Looks: 0/10 - Feel: 0/10 - ""Passability"" 0/10 - Overall: 0/10  I love product presentation, I think it adds to the experience even with reps! It's a big part of why I keep purchasing items I think, the feeling of opening up that Haul or Designer Box and unpacking everything.   It's important for sure. It's not the most important aspect, the products are, but we know that. For now let's talk about the packaging  The White Monogram box is by far the closest in my opinion. The color and the texture seem to be on point from my one retail experience with the LV Trainers. The box text is a nice shiny blue color as well, that I have no idea whether it differs or not between packaging.   The Black Wallet box is okay from a distance. The box lettering is solid black across. The texture is kind of there in specific lighting and there is a size difference to the prior mentioned box. The QR code does work though so there's a plus.  The Belt box is just bad. Dull and Flat color and texture wise (compared to the white wallet box)  Thank You!;;the w2c link for the off white bag is wrong D:","{upvote:1,timestamp:2023-06-17}",Reddit,0,

"Zara,ASOS","quality,price,haul","[REVIEW] DSquared2 Jeans from 8Billion Hey guys,  Purchased some DSquared jeans from 8Bil after seeing some good reviews and decided to try it for myself since Zara sold out of the biker jeans with paint splatters that I wanted.  These were the closest I could find, and heard that these jeans are in fact really nice.  So I thought its worth a shot right?  &#x200B;  **PICS AND W2C:**  [**https://imgur.com/a/YGRze0d**](https://imgur.com/a/YGRze0d)  &#x200B;  My Stats (UK):  Height: 6ft / 183cm  Weight: 15st / 95kg / 210lb  Usual jeans size: 36/32  Waist: 92cm  Outside leg: 42 inch / 107cm  Inside Leg: 76cm  &#x200B;  **FIT:**  I asked if these were stretch skinny, he said kinda so I went for the 54.  They fit kinda nice and they are indeed stretch skinny.  These arent skinny jeans, more like slim fit.  Maybe thats down to the size?  I was expecting sorta drainpipes as the images on the yupoo link showed it, but they fit like a straight leg and look pretty nice regardless.   In all honesty they fit good, I like em and they feel like your standard River Island Jeans, quality for the price is ok.  &#x200B;  **Price:**  Wasn't terrible pricing at all, cost of jeans was **259CNY**, which worked out around ¬£30.  Cheaper than I'd pay for decent jeans at high street prices.  &#x200B;  **Shipping:**  I went direct with 8Bil, and honestly the guy was really helpful, provided a QC and moved pretty quick with everything.  He shipped out 26/01/21 and my package arrived in the UK today (02/01/21).  Making it 6 days via EMS.  Impressed, but it cost me.  Shipping fee was **220CNY** which was pretty much the cost of the jeans.  &#x200B;  **Quality:**  So the quality IS pretty good when you consider the price, would I pay this at high street prices for the same quality jeans?  Probably because I like the design.  I usually buy all my jeans from Zara or River Island, Zara is preferred because of the amazing quality of the jeans, but if you buy cheap jeans from Zara you can really tell.  These don't feel premium either, they feel like I bought average priced high street denim.  Very similar to something I'd grab from ASOS for a little cheaper.  I have seen reviews praising the quality, but these jeans in particular aren't premium or outstanding, they're good.  **Don't expect thick denim, these are thin, and they have a nice stretch..  I would compare them to my jeans with 98% Cotton 2% Elastaine**  &#x200B;  **Verdict:**  Should you grab them?  If you like them, sure.  I didn't have any hauls coming in and had a bit of extra cash and thought I'd have a go and report my findings here.  8Bil is a nice guy, the shipping speed was really quick and he was very responsive on WeChat.  I paid **¬£56** in total for the jeans that took 6 days to get to my house, you might think it was dumb but I was willing to pay that if I found a similar style elsewhere, so overall I'm really happy and glad I did.  I think the next haul I have, I'll get some more but to save on the shipping costs I'll incorporate them as part of a haul, I wouldn't go direct again for one item unless I absolutely loved it.  &#x200B;  Not sure if this was useful to you guys, but hopefully this helps people who were on the fence like me.  The quality is okay, the price is good, the shipping price is expensive, and the fit is nice.  I'm happy overall and wouldn't steer anyone away from 8Bil after my experience, in fact I would recommend him.;;I got jeans from him but I‚Äôm unsure what size to get from him in the UK I am a 32 waist so usually go for the 32 size jeans but I‚Äôm unsure what that converts to in his sizing any help if anyone can tell me the right size to get","{upvote:1,timestamp:2021-02-06}",Reddit,0,

"LV,Dior",,"Review of Chez Pierre's sample pack of Fragrances What's up repfam, after a week of testing  I'm going to review a sample package with 10 fragrances by Chez Pierre.  I have tried 5 fragrances, one a day, to test longevity and fragrance throughout the day.  **Experience with the Seller:**  * Communication and responsiveness was pretty good, some delays in responses due to time zones and weekends but otherwise good.  Friendly and prompt and answered all questions and concerns I had.  * Logistics were good and surprisingly fast even though sent by regular mail. First package got lost in transit but they were quick to rectify it and send another package.  * Shipped May 24th * Received Package June 2nd  **Disclaimer:**  * I am not an expert by any means and even though 10 samples were sent in the sampler I will only be reviewing the ones I have tried the real versions of * These were sent to me for free to test and review * These are my impressions and yours may be different than my experience * Perfumes are inspired by famous fragrances. Some notes may be different but all are pretty close to the original fragrances.  #Reviews:  * First let me start off by saying that I have seen many others make statements about the longevity of the scents but my experience was good and they lasted for most of the day. The one issue I did have was when I first received the package I took every fragrance out and sprayed them on test strips to smell them and they gave me a headache from smelling them all. However when I only sprayed one for the day to test they didn't bother me or give me a headache so I'm chalking it up to spraying so much and smelling them all together.   ##Bakar  (Baccarat Rouge 540)  A floral and woody scent with notes of jasmine, saffron, cedarwood and ambergris. This was my favorite of all the samples and I would recommend this one for anyone who likes sweeter fragrances. From the first spray it was very sweet and pleasant throughout the day. The scent lasted about 6 hours or so and didn't lose any of its depth until after that. This one was by far the closest to retail.  9/10  ##Wild Bergamot  (Dior Sauvage)  An earthy and woody scent with notes of Bergamot, pepper and amberwood. Very strong to start off, maybe a little too strong, but settles after a bit and holds fragrance well for 8-10 hours. Pretty close to the real fragrance and the scent stays longer than the others.  7.5/10  ##Luxurious  (LV Ombre Nomade)  A woody and fruity scent with notes of oud wood, Raspberry and incense. To be fair I have only tried and smelled this in stores but in my opinion is pretty close to the real fragrance. Retail smells much more rich and deeper than this clone but the scent is very accurate and lasted for a good amount of time and settled nicely after a little bit. This is not my type of fragrance but if you like the real version this is a great alternative.   8/10  ##Leathery Path  (Tom Ford Tuscan Leather)  A warm and spicy scent with notes of leather, saffron and black suede. Another strong fragrance to start off but settles in nicely. Not much depth to the fragrance and you have to really breath it in to get hints of the secondary notes. It is fairly close to retail and has good longevity to it.   7/10   ##Aventure  (Creed Aventus)  A fruity and rich scent with notes of Bergamot, black currant, apple and pineapple. From the first spray the scent of pineapple and citrus is very apparent but after it settles in it has a nice sweet and fruity scent. Lasted very long pretty much all day and is pretty close to retail.  7.5/10   If you want to try Chez Pierre's perfumes I'll leave his contacts here:  **W2C**:  [Direct Link](https://chez-pierre.com/samples)  **Whatsapp**:  +381 63 414753  **[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/PxUHm0p)**;;His Versace Eros clone is nothing like retail","{upvote:4,timestamp:2023-06-12}",Reddit,1,0

You could put everything into it and it had two cupholders/bottleholders for your drinks while you play handball or whatever. TNF doesn't make this model anymore and I was very happy to snag these for the nostalgia factor (didn't want the supreme collab version). These also come with a strap that you can attach so you can sling it over your shoulder. I plan to use these when I go hiking or on casual walks.

The print looks and feels great.  &#x200B;  **STONE ISLAND split sweater XXL -----**  ***205y to WeGoBuy warehouse*** [\+QC](https://imgur.com/a/rBpoZub)  This isn't exactly a retail piece nor is it a fantasy piece either, rather its a mix of the two. This is a poorly attempted OLD DYE sweatshirt replica, not sure which season (see [here](https://imgur.com/a/gm9QNNd)). It looks and feels great. Patch on the arm is OKAY, doesn't really matter to me but if that sort of thing bothers you then you can cop a patch from busystone or stone store or where ever to replace it. The only issue with mine which I should've seen in QC pics is that the embroidery on the neck tag on the inside is off center.  &#x200B;  # MASKS  **""Surgical Masks"" 100 pieces -----** ***300y to WeGoBuy warehouse*** [\+QC](https://imgur.com/a/agXQR51)  As required by our state, we have to wear some sort of face covering.  &#x200B;  **""KN95 Masks"" 30 pieces (but seller gave 32)-** ***298.80y to WeGoBuy warehouse*** [\+QC](https://imgur.com/a/YyWoIFL)  For those of you that are asking me how effective the KN95 masks are, I have posted a highlighted screenshot straight from the CDC (Center for Disease Control, U.S.), as well as a photo of the above masks with the correct certification number printed directly on them. Of course for any mask to be effective you would have to have a tight seal between your face and the mask.

(i exchanged the 50 for the 52)  accuracy   what i quickly saw was the lower ending of the leather on the right side (left side of the photo), which is almost cutting into the button underneath - this doesnt happen on the original   also the arrows on the pockets seem rather badly stitched   finally the collar (?) seems off, but other than that i'm pretty happy about the aesthetic   (additional infos from /u/quirintus)   \- the buttons are misplaced (the top part should have been between the 2nd and 3rd button)   \- the leather is thin compared to retail   \- wrong mold of the buttons (should have a wavy line pattern around them)  overall (5.1/10)   final verdict: looks great, feels cheap, no chance of sliding through as real   lucky as i'm i only found out about the peltiano & cloyad teddy after i've already shipped this jacket (eventhough i've read that those are also lacking in the quality department)   i will probably buy this jacket a second time if there is a batch that is clearly better than those we had, but its (barely) good enough to wear outside as i only care about the beautiful design  questions to y'all:   with all the photos & infos - would you have gl or rl this item?  https://preview.redd.it/ruqumdj9f6t61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3b65cc02011c86befd331e7537baf18ef128be3  https://preview.redd.it/hmml8rfgd6t61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24cba5351e77d516f8d18b584f32c273017320ce;;Recommend go for reon on this piece 200$ but worth it","{upvote:3,timestamp:2021-05-01}",Reddit,0,

Adidas,,"[WDYWT] Opinion: Adidas pants are terrible, but Calabasas fixed everything wrong about them ;;The original Adidas Sweatpants are waaaay to tight, have an annoying tapered fit around the ankles (and weird zippers at the ankles) and on top of that the branding is horrible. Everything down to the very cut of the pants just make them bad for anything but workout. However the calabasas sweatpants fixed everything wrong with them. The boxy and oversized fit is amazing, the way they sit on the ankles complements the footwear and overall just looks cool. Additionally they are obviously WAAAAAYYYY better quality and also they have superb branding (if you gotta go heavy on branding this is how to do it). Besides this cw is just beautiful...  The fit is obviously quite lazy, but I think it complements the pants well. This is my first post in here, dont be too harsh :D","{upvote:-5,timestamp:2019-05-28}",Reddit,1,0

The review is so long that my phone can‚Äôt even handle it no more. If I have this review opened, it drains my battery and I can‚Äôt even type anything without my keyboard displaying the lagging input. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them below. I can also provide in hand pictures of most of these items.

Uniqlo,"quality,price,haul,comparison","Best & Worst Pieces Of My Hauls Vuja De 004 Flannel  Price: ¬•168 - [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=648876376866)  Size Small - Shoulder 49 | Chest 60cm | Length 70cm| Sleeve 60cm  Rating: 7.5/10  The flannel has some thickness/weight to it. The sleeves are abit too long for me, but fits well on body. I find the holes and distressed effect abit tacky. I think it's good value for money, considering the quality.   *Recommend?* You do need to factor in agent fees and shipping fees, but for the design, quality, and inflation in retail stores, i'd say it's a solid cop.  I came across a [¬•138](https://m.tb.cn/h.5OkOiZ4?tk=GYgHW4T5eNb) and [¬•78](https://m.tb.cn/h.5OklTf8?tk=5KFxW4T5Y5q) Could be the same batch, not sure, might buy the ¬•78 in the future to do a comparison if people want. If it's the same quality - absolute steal.  Airism Tee's Price: ¬•39.99 - [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=708954904270)  Size Small - Shoulder 49cm | Chest 53cm | Length 64cm | Sleeve 26cm  Rating: 7/10  Light weight & abit stretchy. Saw a review from a redditor and copped. Apparently it's similar quality to Uniqlo's arisim material. Never had it uniqlo, but this is a solid shirt. I can never find a oversized tee that I like, will be buying more if needed.  *Recommend?* Yes.   Long Sleeve Top  Price: ¬•49.90 - [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=733210919281) Size Medium | Shoulder 51cm |Chest 49cm| Length 67cm| Sleeve 50cm Rating: 6/10 The quality is fine. Sleeves are abit short, but sizing up would make the length abit long. *Recommend?*  Yeah, if it's within your means  Beige turtle neck hoodie.   Price: ¬•76 - [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=681578733967) Rating: 7/10  Size Medium -   Nice quality, especially for ¬•76. I think it's made out of viscose/spandex? This turtle neck is very slim fit.   *Recommend?* I wouldn't purchase again, but for slim people this is great!   Sage Mink sweater  Price: ¬•98 - [W2C](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=608984062792)  Rating: 6.5/10  Size Medium - Shoulder 40cm | Chest 46cm | Length 65cm | Sleeve 57cm  This is decent quality. Only problem is sleeves are slightly short, so check size chart.  *Recommend?* If you like the look and are slim built  Turtle neck  Price: ¬•38 - [W2C](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=660878621174)  Rating 9/10  Size Large - Shoulder 42cm | Chest 49cm | Sleeve: 59cm | Length: 66cm  This is where I'll buy turtle necks from now on. Amazing quality, beats turtles necks from retailers. *Recommend?*: 10000% Yes  Brown Corduroy Pants  Rating 7/10  Price: ¬•98 - [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=690585190357)  Size: Medium - Waist: 29cm | Outseam 95cm | Inner seam 6 exe7cm | Leg opening: 18cm  Bought these pants from a review i saw. They said it'd be around ¬£100+ in vinena. I'd say that value should be atleast half imo, in UK. Initially I didn't like it, but it grew on me. The quality is very nice,and at the price point, however too long for myself. I wouldn't buy again, but if they did me perfectly I would purchase again.  DreamWorks T-Shirt  Price - ¬•49 - [W2C](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=615875475700)  Rating 7.5/10  Size Medium - Shoulder 46cm | Chest 51.5cm | Length 66cm | Sleeve 19.5cm  Standard T-shirt. I'd say price quality is representing of price. Fit is good, quality is not thin.  *Recommend?* Yes  Musfasa T-shirt.  Price: ¬•49 - [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=614281367363)  Size Medium   Rating: 6.5/10   The quality is mediocre, the print is what makes the shirt imo. Cannot find shirt atm, will post measurements later. I recommend sizing up twice, or at least once if you are slim.  *Recommend?*: If you like the look, yeah.  IDLT hoodie  Price - ¬•249 - [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=684632053297)  Size Small  Rating: 8/10   Thick hoodie, good quality. Probably 450- 550gsm. Will post measurements later but it's well reviewed on the sub. Abit big on myself so am selling in the future. Fits oversized. I don't recommend purchasing a S if you are below 5ft6, unless you want to be Ariana Grande when the sleeves are fully extended.   *Recommend?* Yes  Carhart Socks  Price: ¬•12.98 - [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=653734124147)  Size: 39-45  Rating 6.5/10  White socks. Not thin but not thick. Got a sock haul coming in soon, so can compare in depth when it comes.  *Recommend?* White sock brev. Feet like it.;;Link to shop for that turtle neck?

,haul,"""w h e r e i s m y p a r c e l"" and other tales of the sea - a brief guide to international shipping and why your haul is probably fine What up repfam  This post explains 90% of the questions people have about shipping, including such classics as ‚Äúwhere is my shit‚Äù, ‚Äúhas my haul been seized‚Äù, and ""where is my shit"" again.  First up, this guide applies for EMS parcels. EUB parcels follow the same process, but have sporadic updates (often going for weeks at a time). Also there is some UK-centric language but the thrust applies worldwide.  &#x200B;  **Q - How does international shipping work?**  Once you put your shipment together via your agent, there are basically three stages to your haul arriving at your door  * Getting the package prepared for export from China including clearing export customs (1) * Getting the package on an aircraft (2) * Your parcel clearing import customs in your country so it can be delivered to you (3).  At Stage (1), your agent bundles the parcel together and the necessary export customs formalities are filed (i.e. declaring what is in the package and the total value of the goods). The goods are transported to a cargo warehouse at an airport in China, where they may be inspected by export customs.  Very occasionally, the goods will not be allowed to be exported and will be returned to the warehouse - this happens for numerous reasons ranging from the parcel not being properly sealed, to the wrong customs details being filed, to the package being opened and counterfeit goods being seized.  Your parcel moves into Stage (2) when Chinese customs approve them for export and they are moved into an airside cargo warehouse. At this point it is tallied, planned for loading on an aircraft, put together with other parcels and then loaded onto an aircraft to start its journey towards your country.  This is frequently a long stage in the process. EMS and EUB parcels are transported in the hold of commercial aircraft which have finite capacity, so in situations where this capacity is reduced (i.e. less aircraft are flying like now with COVID-19) or where demand is high (i.e. at Christmas or Chinese New Year) there are more parcels than it is possible to fit on an aircraft. Your parcel will be held in the secure area of the warehouse until it is possible to board an aircraft.  Once your parcel has made its journey to your country, you enter Stage (3). Once disembarked from the aircraft your parcel is taken into another cargo warehouse where it is scanned to confirm arrival in the country and is presented to import customs for inspection. While export customs is a formality and the vast majority of parcels are waved through by import customs, instances of detailed customs inspection and seizure at this stage are somewhat more frequent.  Once your parcel clears import customs, it is transported within your country to the relevant local delivery agent who delivers it to your door. Depending on the size of your country, this can take a substantial amount of time.  &#x200B;  **Q - How long should my parcel take to arrive?**  China Post‚Äôs tracking service documents the average arrival times of all parcels for some frequent countries as follows. If your haul has not arrived and the ‚Äúlongest‚Äù number of days has not elapsed, you should not be concerned.  Country - Average Delivery Time - Longest Time - Shortest Time  * Australia / New Zealand : 12 - 15 - 9 * Canada : 30 - 60 - 10 * EU : 17 - 44 - 7 * United Kingdom : 12 - 40 - 6 * United States : 16 - 62 - 8  As you can see, *a delivery time of 40+ days for Europe and North America is frequent*. (source: China Post)  &#x200B;  **Q - What does ‚Äúshipping notice received‚Äù (or similar) mean?**  This means the agent has put a tracking number from China Post on your parcel (i.e. a sticker with a barcode and scanned it), but has not shipped the goods yet. It can take two to three business days for the goods to be shipped as the agent will be waiting for China Post to collect the goods.  Infrequently, if you have purchased directly from a seller and have chased them to confirm your goods have been shipped after QC, some asswipes will give you a fake tracking number. If the status remains ‚Äúshipping notice received‚Äù after four days or more you should chase them to actually ship the goods. In most cases, sellers will take immediate action to ship the goods to avoid disputes and reputational damage.  &#x200B;  **Q - It's been a couple of days since I finalised my haul, why hasn't anything happened?**  In general, to avoid disappointment you should start counting days from when the parcel is collected (it says this specifically on your agent's site and on 17track) rather than the date you submitted the parcel.  Paying for your parcel today doesn't mean it will be in the hands of China Post tomorrow - it takes time to physically bundle up the parcel, allocate a tracking number and get China Post to physically collect at the warehouse. It can often take two to three business days for this to happen and your haul to update that the tracking number has been activated.  Agents and (more frequently) direct sellers will tell you ""the item has shipped, but the shipping company hasn't given the tracking information yet"" when in reality your parcel is still in the warehouse - sometimes it takes a week to be picked up.  &#x200B;  **Q - What does ‚Äúdelivered to air transport‚Äù / ‚Äúdespatched to \[my country\]‚Äù (or similar) mean?**  This means that China Post has given the parcel to the airline company - it does NOT mean that the parcel is on a plane.  This status will not update for a long time until the parcel arrives at the destination airport and is scanned by the domestic parcel company. It is not unheard of for this to take between two and four weeks in regular season, and four to six weeks during holiday season or where there are complications like COVID.  If you are worried you can ask your agent to confirm which flight your parcel is on. If they are able to give you a flight number, it is worth noting they do not always see the date of the flight and this could still be in the future - you should not assume your parcel has left China.  &#x200B;  **Q - How can I check progress on my parcel?**  Until the point of arrival in your country, 17track is the most detailed resource to keep up to date on your parcel‚Äôs progress. ParcelsApp also has good feedback.  &#x200B;  **Q - There seem to be a lot of delays, should I ship my parcel now or wait?**  This is similar to driving to a friend‚Äôs house cross-country when the traffic is awful all the time - the sooner you leave, the sooner you‚Äôll get there. Things won‚Äôt be any faster by delaying your haul.  &#x200B;  **Q - Has my haul been seized?!**  In all likelihood, no. Your parcel status will update saying it is being inspected by customs at the point of seizure. A lack of status updates is probably a good thing in that sense.  &#x200B;  **Q - Is my parcel lost??!?!!?1111?@**  In all likelihood, no. These things are very rare and if you are worried about this happening you should purchase the relevant insurance protection from your agent before finalising your shipment.  &#x200B;  **Q - My parcel has been scanned by customs but it hasn't been updated to say customs has been cleared. Has my haul been seized???**  In all likelihood, no. The scan to confirm the parcel has cleared customs doesn‚Äôt necessarily take place in the warehouse and often takes place while the parcel is being loaded into a lorry or when it arrives at your local sorting office. As per the above, unless there is a notice specifically saying your parcel is being inspected by customs you probably have nothing to worry about.  &#x200B;  **Q - What can I do to hurry things up?**  Literally nothing. This is how international shipping works, so get comfortable with it. Posting on the sub asking how other people‚Äôs parcels are progressing won‚Äôt make yours arrive any faster.  &#x200B;  Hope this is helpful and do ask any more questions below so we have a good FAQ resource.;;I've shipped 10-15 hauls between using Superbuy and Taobao direct.

"LV,Gucci","price,haul","[GUIDE] How Not to Get Your Haul Seized by Customs [ALL COUNTRIES] Hello everyone!  I've seen quite a bit of new posts concerning seizure, methods to not get seized, etc. I would like to try and clear up and confusion about customs seizing parcels and the best method to increase your chances of not getting seized.  &#x200B;  **USA GUIDE:**  First, find out how much each item is in weight. On the shopping agent SuperBuy, you can check this by simply looking next to each item and seeing the estimated weight that is shown.  Next, see if your haul exceeds 6-7kg. If its not, continue to the next step. If it is, then split it how ever many times you need to til both hauls are not above 6-7kg. For example, if your total items in warehouse is 12kg, then ship 2 6kg hauls. You can also put all brands of interest in one package (gucci, lv, brands customs would seize for) and keep all your other lowkey brands that most customs wouldnt know in the other package (assc, bape, off white, golf wang, supreme). Hauls **HAVE** gotten through above 7kg, but this weight is the best weight for your money for shipping, as the dollar per kg is of less value at higher kgs. This is shown by previous research.  Yay, now its time to ship out your haul(s)! I would use EMS, as it has the highest percentage of not getting seized and is fast (3-5 days for me) and cheap. As you may know, the US tax limit is $800. That means that you can declare your package up to $800 and it will not be taxed. BUT, very recently, China customs have been cracking down on heavy packages (hence why 6-7kg is good) and packages declared ABOVE $130. So, declare a value under $130. It's weight should be reflective on the value and the contents inside incase of seizure and inspecting, so declare a reasonable value. If your package is 6-7kg, I would declare almost to $130, like $120. If it's 3-4kg, declare $70. if theres shoes in your package, add $30, so that makes $100. Again, make this declaration value reasonable for the customs inspector incase of opening, and be able to make a list of each items worth to back up your claims.  You will declare your package when you get to the shipping page, there should be a place to put it. I shipped two 7kg parcels, so I declared both at $120.  You're almost done! Now, when it asks if you want insurance or not, this ONLY covers if your package gets seized/lost in CHINA. Not if your country seizes it. I have seen this get mixed up many times, you will not get reimbursed if you have insurance for a package seized in your country. I usually don't get insurance. Now for SuperBuy, you can do value added services. What this does is possibly reduce the weight of your parcel to make shipping less (you'll get refunded after receiving if its less) and make it harder for customs to open. A win-win. Anyways, on SuperBuy, I remove brand tags (not the stitched in tag, the plastic tag that has the price and what not), brand packaging (shoeboxes, plastic bags, etc. Removing shoeboxes helps a LOT for shipping price), and simple packaging (not sure what it does, but it's good lol). Then if you check the value added services checkmark, you should add moisture barrier bag and plastic film. This makes it less appealing and harder for customs to open, as they have to take the time to cut all of the extra layers. It's like covering your package in saran wrap 2000 times over.  Great, now it's time to ship out your package and pay the shipping price! If you followed the steps, you should be well on your way to getting that sweet 1:1 succ from the guangdong warehouse.  &#x200B;  **ANY OTHER COUNTRY:**  First, find out how much each item is in weight. On the shopping agent SuperBuy, you can check this by simply looking next to each item and seeing the estimated weight that is shown.  Next, we need to see if you need to split your haul. This really depends per country. Search in FashionReps for people in the same country and see what they did. I would keep it up to 6-7kg MAXIMUM. If its not, continue to the next step. If it is, then split it how ever many times you need to til both hauls are not above 6-7kg. For example, France is really strict and the tax limit is 22 EUR, so I would ship around 3-4kg MAX per haul for that country, but it changes per country, you just need to search.. You can also put all brands of interest in one package (gucci, lv, brands customs would seize for) and keep all your other lowkey brands that most customs wouldnt know in the other package (assc, bape, off white, golf wang, supreme). Hauls **HAVE** gotten through above 7kg, but this weight is the best weight for your money for shipping, as the dollar per kg is of less value at higher kgs. This is shown by previous research.  Yay, now its time to ship out your haul(s)! For shipping lines to pick, search in fashionreps your country and what shipping line people use. If you were shipping to France, EMS would be the safest. This varies per country, as well as country tax. Country tax threshold varies per country. Google ""\[country\] parcel import tax threshold"" and you should be able to find what yours is. For example, if I'm in France, I can only declare my parcel up to 22 EUR. I would just declare the top value (20 EUR or so for France would be good) and keep your fingers crossed, as theres not much else you can do.  You will declare your package when you get to the shipping page, there should be a place to put it. If you shipped two 7kg parcels, declare both at 20 EUR (if in France)  You're almost done! Now, when it asks if you want insurance or not, this ONLY covers if your package gets seized/lost in CHINA. Not if your country seizes it. I have seen this get mixed up many times, you will not get reimbursed if you have insurance for a package seized in your country. I usually don't get insurance. Now for SuperBuy, you can do value added services. What this does is possibly reduce the weight of your parcel to make shipping less (you'll get refunded after receiving if its less) and make it harder for customs to open. A win-win. Anyways, on SuperBuy, I remove brand tags (not the stitched in tag, the plastic tag that has the price and what not), brand packaging (shoeboxes, plastic bags, etc. Removing shoeboxes helps a LOT for shipping price), and simple packaging (not sure what it does, but it's good lol). Then if you check the value added services checkmark, you should add moisture barrier bag and plastic film. This makes it less appealing and harder for customs to open, as they have to take the time to cut all of the extra layers. It's like covering your package in saran wrap 2000 times over.  &#x200B;  **CONCLUSION:**  Great, now it's time to ship out your package and pay the shipping price! If you followed the steps, you should be well on your way to getting that sweet 1:1 succ from the guangdong warehouse. I hope you enjoyed my guide, spent a lot of time on this. Don't want y'all losing your succ!;;or you can hit them with a chinese grandma method","{upvote:8,timestamp:2019-08-04}",Reddit,0,

[**Kevin b23**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=613017894680)  Im not pro quality checker, but you can't go wrong with kevin.

Even if it is flawed in the eyes of a supreme head, gonna rock this bitch while skating, no one will know the difference.  # Burberry Flannel  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/rEtLpJ2) |[ Fitpics](https://imgur.com/a/UIY3neF)  WTC:[ OOS](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=580181585149)  Rating: 9/10  Price: $36.07  This was one of my GP‚Äôs (as far as I know) that I was really excited about. The material isn't as heavy as normal flannel material, but still thick enough to keep you warm. Has proper washtags and neck tag, and even engraved buttons. Once in hand I instantly fell in love with this piece. Unfortunately it has since gone OOS, but in their store they have plenty of other Burberry items, and when buying this, there was only a couple other purchases, so maybe message and ask the seller if there is any stock left?

In terms of quality, I love this hoodie. As retail, the blank is thicker than a Snickers, and could really hold up during some harsh winter conditions. The embroidery passes as far as i'm concerned, and honestly couldn‚Äôt give a fuck if someone tries to call me out - whole idea is just childish, rock your clothes with confidence. Enough soapboxing, seriously Teenage club did an excellent job with this hoodie, washtags and neck tags seem to be on point, side tag is a little wonky, but this thing dropped in 2008 so there‚Äôs some room for imperfections.  # Stone Island Overshirt x3  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/NNERX5v) |[ Fitpics](https://imgur.com/a/MzOgAsk)  [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=599081333543)  Rating: 8/10  Price: $44.44  I do enjoy these jackets but there is one thing that really bothered me - the pink. Comparing to retail, the color on the jacket Stoney produced is pretty off, it's much more darker and muted than what is shown for the retail listing, almost a light plum color. Nevertheless, the quality is still bar none, and will be slaying with these pieces left and right regardless of color.  # Canada Goose Vest  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/8hsgz55) |[ Fitpics](https://imgur.com/a/e7b5n4L)  [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=604230734955&spm=1101.1101.N.N.d389e9f)  Rating: 11/10  Price: $44.94  I have had my eye on a Canada Goose vest since I had bought Feiyu‚Äôs Langford jacket, but given Feiyu‚Äôs prices, I couldn‚Äôt rationalize spending that type of bread on something I may or may not wear much. A couple months back some sellers on the sub released a ‚Äúbudget batch‚Äù for Canada Goose jackets, and vests. After getting this thing in hand, and comparing to my langford, they really go hand and hand in terms of quality. Granted the langford is a lot more complex to replicate, and would still suggest going to Feiyu with a purchase of a jacket, but 3125 Tiger‚Äôs vest is up there in there in terms of quality. The collar has this beautiful material that‚Äôs level of softness matches that of the Nelly crewnecks everyone loves, the down located inside this vest immediately puffed up and gives a level of thickness that will keep any torso warm on a cold evening. The badge varies from what I have seen on other QC around the sub, (\*disclaimer, I am by no means an expert QCer) but I believe I got pretty lucky. The pockets on this bad boy are DEEP, you could easily fit a young child in them and still have room to spare, reminds me of the Places + Faces bag. The buttons have deep logo engraving, and are laced with some fatty YKK zippers. Once again, I am very impressed with this purchase, and suggest if you are on a budget and looking for CG, purchase this vest with confidence!  # The North Face Light Jacket  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/MeOX9Tu) |[ Fitpics](https://imgur.com/a/IJhyy1s)  [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=602554766964&spm=1101.1101.N.N.dd4f0a8)  Rating: 9/10  Price: $53.95  Another GP that I was happily surprised with. Initially when I got this in hand, I was disappointed that this was not a down jacket, as I intended to use this for snowboarding. After wearing this out for a couple of weeks, I have come to LOVE this jacket. Being a sort of windbreaker, it is a nice layering jacket that despite being as light as it is, still keeps you extremely warm. The claim of ‚ÄúGore-Tex‚Äù has held up pretty well to the times that I have worn this in the rain (has that affect where the water balls up and runs off). Being that it is probably just a coating on the jacket that will come off with time (similar to the shoe protection sprays) I am excited to how it holds up to the winter season of boarding. Looking at the embroidery, I do think it is a little sloppy on close inspection, but if someone is about to call me out for TNF i‚Äôll be really surprised. Again YKK zippers, and strong clasps on the hood, and inside on the bottom to taper the look against your body. Great quality for the price.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # ACCESSORIES:  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # Common Projects Achilles Low  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/smsukQs) |[ Fitpics](https://imgur.com/a/eRy5CKR)  [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=560811388969)  Rating: 9/10  Price: $44.14  Bought these last year, tried them on once, and sold them. These are more of a 12-12.5, but if you‚Äôre determined enough you can stretch these out to fit 12.5-13. The quality as many have reviewed before, is amazing, stamping is A+ on the side, only real flaw is the laces not being waxed as retails, but if that really bothers you, there‚Äôs a link floating around somewhere for accurate laces. Love these shoes to death despite being a tad too small, the initial breaking-in pain is totally worth it.  # Kaws x Baby Milo Figure  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/CvW0bIY)  [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=556824132652)  Rating: 10/10  Price: $13.23  Had to get another kaws figure, my first one was getting lonely. Same seller as the first, and quality is matched, only gripe is that the dye used for the green is a little lighter on the Baby Milo figure. Ultimate room flex once you learn the resell on these.  # Number (N)ine Ring  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/NMahsZB) |[ Fitpics](https://imgur.com/a/hJ0Kefh)  [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=551391351513)  Rating: 8/10  Price: $4.15  Had a friend get this ring a while back‚Ä¶ this thing is like a fidget spinner on crack, the way that they move, it is so satisfying to toy around with all day. Unfortunately this does come at a cost - my friend who has had them for around a year now reported that the ink for the music note ring wears off.  # Alyx Rollercoaster Belt  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/NLykEpk) |[ Fitpics](https://imgur.com/a/qveVy8M)  [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=561733803430)  Rating: 8/10  Price: $10.51  Great quality on the latch itself, but is rather bulky for some pants. Regular 141 Levis will not let this belt through the loops, but with some looser jeans it is possible. I have a pair of Volcom skate jeans that I wear on a daily basis and they fit nice and snug. Only problem is it does take a considerable amount of time to get it on and off. Tag on the backside of the belt looks extremely cheap and poorly stitched, but if you are going for the budget batch of this belt, you can‚Äôt complain.  # Burberry Underwear Pack  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/ZIFoOpG) |[ Fitpics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vkF-k56b2g)  [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=598087124891)  Rating: 7/10  Price: $9.42  Not very impressed with these, fairly thin, but get the job done. They are definitely on par with that one popular boxer sellers pairs, but a tad worse. On the plus side they do come in a pack of three, but you are better off buying some fruit of the loom or champion boxers for cheap.

"Gucci,Dior","quality,price","Review of Gucci and Dior sunglasses from Markin In hand photos:  http://imgur.com/gallery/tJgQa46  Review:  Bough the above glasses, female dior and male gucci, from Markin. Price of the gucci ones was 50 USD and the dior was 55. Payment through PayPal F&F, confirmed immediately. Shipping was included. Asked markin to send them asap, he did say shipping takes 10-18 days, offered ems for 15 usd extra but I didn't take the option.  Tracking was tricky, they arrived at the UK first, no update for days, but at the end they came here for 9 working days which is amazing.  Excellent communication and service. He advised all his glasses were UV400, I took the gucci ones to a local store for testing, they said that's correct and I've nothing to worry about.  Quality of both pairs is impeccable. Service is great. Really well deserved 10/10.;;Markin's details for WTC:  wechat:markin520 whatsapp:+8618823726241 yupoo:http://den1218.x.yupoo.com/albums","{upvote:1,timestamp:2019-05-26}",Reddit,0,

"Nike,Versace,Burberry,Ralph Lauren","price,haul","4.3KG HAUL (Ralph Lauren, Fendi, Stone Island, Versace + more) This is my 6th haul and I decided to do a review of it as this is my favorite one so far.  This is also kinda budget, brands bought are Ralph Lauren, Fendi, Stone Island, Versace, Burberry, Heron Preston, Nike  \#Haul Information  Shipped to Sweden  Shipping  - Ôø•456 + 45$ for Swedish tax -.-  Weight - 4360g  Declaration - $20  \#Stats  Height - 6ft / 183cm  Weight - 138lbs / 63kg  Shoe size - 43 / 44 (usually 43)  Clothing size - Hoodie/crewnecks: Medium.

Thought this would be too small but its just right. The material is almost athleisure I would say, feels like the Hugo Boss saggy hoodies, so it's really great for the price. Haven't seen a review of this so I guess this is a GP? Probably somebody has copped this before but found this from an old link in Couturereps. Size M - 9/10   W2C - [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3004768280&spider\_token=1b75](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=3004768280&spider_token=1b75)   \#Fendi sweater  [https://www.cssbuy.com/photo/view.html?type=o&id=NTQxMjA1](https://www.cssbuy.com/photo/view.html?type=o&id=NTQxMjA1)   The material feels really good and the logo stitching looks really good as well, a couple of loose threads tho but they were easily removed. One thing about this is the fit though, the sleeves are a little too big for my liking but works. 7/10 Size M TTS  W2C - DEAD (was from 3125Tiger tho)  \#Budget Heron Preston Hoodie + Tee  [https://www.cssbuy.com/photo/view.html?type=o&id=NTkxODQ1](https://www.cssbuy.com/photo/view.html?type=o&id=NTkxODQ1) /  [https://www.cssbuy.com/photo/view.html?type=o&id=NTkzNTY2](https://www.cssbuy.com/photo/view.html?type=o&id=NTkzNTY2)   Hoodie - The hoodie is really nice, oversized fit tho which I'm not a fan of but I decided to cop this anyways because the design is really cool, and tbh the fit wasn't too bad if you like the oversized look this is a really good piece. Material is really soft, don't know how good it will hold up when washing tho. 7/10 Size M TTS  Tee - Damn this was my biggest disappointment of this haul, the fit just looks awkward IMO and the material is very stiff and not that comfortable, also the shiny thing on the t-shirt is really easy to peel off and will probably fall off over time. Cheap through but will probably never be worn. 5/10 Size S TTS  W2C -  [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=601496931428&sku=20509:28316;1627207:28341&sku\_id=4202726640772](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=601496931428&sku=20509:28316;1627207:28341&sku_id=4202726640772)   \#Ralph Lauren sweater gray  [https://www.cssbuy.com/photo/view.html?type=o&id=NTQwNjEx](https://www.cssbuy.com/photo/view.html?type=o&id=NTQwNjEx)   This has been reviewed very much and I see why. For the price this is absolutely amazing, the material feels really good kinda thin though but that's not a problem for me, but what's best about this piece is the fit, slim fit and just right in the shoulder area. I really recommend this 10/10.

I own a retail t-shirt with the same logo and the logo is not 1:1 but not too bad. The stitching is a lot rougher obviously and the outer line is thicker than the retail, I'd never imagine getting called out in this though. 9/10 Size S TTS  W2C -  [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=2566750800&spider\_token=c280](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=2566750800&spider_token=c280)   \#Burberry polo  [https://www.cssbuy.com/photo/view.html?type=o&id=NTg5NjI1](https://www.cssbuy.com/photo/view.html?type=o&id=NTg5NjI1)   Material is good, the badge is barely visible so IDK about it lol but looks solid and clean, no loose threads.

"Chanel,Versace",,"Bought 4 fragrances from Chez Pierre (The Perfume Guy) a month ago and it‚Äôs time for a review. First of all the guy already has a reputable customer service standard which I can fully back so no more needs to be said. Same with pricing for what you get, really good.  Shipping (UK) takes a bit longer than what we‚Äôve grown accustomed to - just over 3 weeks paid - but hey we are a live fast die young culture, so can‚Äôt complain too much.  To the fragrances:  Blue Chance (Bleu de Chanel) - 8/10   It‚Äôs just Bleu de Chanel all over and has always been a fave for me. It‚Äôs a daily perfume and always has been, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve not rated too highly as it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm so used to.   Aventure (Creed Aventus) - 6/10  Meh. I‚Äôve always though Aventus is crazy hyped, but I wanted a little piece to see what it‚Äôs like. It‚Äôs fruity with a bit of woody after tone. There are other Creed fragrances that I would put way before this (I smelled Green Irish Tweed last year and proper rated it). So yeah I‚Äôm not convinced.  Vermos (Versace Eros) - 7/10  This is just Eros. Why only 7 though you ask? I don‚Äôt go to clubs or party that much because of how 32 I am, I just wanted the option for a midlife crisis.   Hint of vanilla (Tobacco and Vanilla TF) - 9.5/10  This. This is my jam. I just think it‚Äôs the wrong season for it is all. It‚Äôs a cosy fragrance for a winter in a tucked away coffee shop or an evening at a fancy hunting lodge (if that‚Äôs a thing. I will say it‚Äôs not a young lad‚Äôs scent though.  https://shop.chezpierre.rs  u/peracar00  My overall impression has been a positive one for sure, I would highly recommend.;;Thinking of buying some soon myself, what ratio do you go for?

Dior,,"What has been your favourite celebrity styling from Law Roach? Like many, I'm still devastated after hearing Law Roach (American stylist) announced his retirement two days ago. Not to get too political, but can't imagine his experience working in the industry and still not getting the recognition he truly deserves after all these years. But it's great to hear that his relationship with Zendaya still remains strong and will continue supporting her.   My question is: From iconic red carpet looks to editorials to show stopping MET Gala looks, what has been your favourite celebrity styling done from Law?   Whether recent or from previous years.  For me, it's hard to choose between these are my top three!

"LV,Dior",,"Review of Chez Pierre's sample pack of Fragrances What's up repfam, after a week of testing  I'm going to review a sample package with 10 fragrances by Chez Pierre.  I have tried 5 fragrances, one a day, to test longevity and fragrance throughout the day.  **Experience with the Seller:**  * Communication and responsiveness was pretty good, some delays in responses due to time zones and weekends but otherwise good.  Friendly and prompt and answered all questions and concerns I had.  * Logistics were good and surprisingly fast even though sent by regular mail. First package got lost in transit but they were quick to rectify it and send another package.  * Shipped May 24th * Received Package June 2nd  **Disclaimer:**  * I am not an expert by any means and even though 10 samples were sent in the sampler I will only be reviewing the ones I have tried the real versions of * These were sent to me for free to test and review * These are my impressions and yours may be different than my experience * Perfumes are inspired by famous fragrances. Some notes may be different but all are pretty close to the original fragrances.  #Reviews:  * First let me start off by saying that I have seen many others make statements about the longevity of the scents but my experience was good and they lasted for most of the day. The one issue I did have was when I first received the package I took every fragrance out and sprayed them on test strips to smell them and they gave me a headache from smelling them all. However when I only sprayed one for the day to test they didn't bother me or give me a headache so I'm chalking it up to spraying so much and smelling them all together.   ##Bakar  (Baccarat Rouge 540)  A floral and woody scent with notes of jasmine, saffron, cedarwood and ambergris. This was my favorite of all the samples and I would recommend this one for anyone who likes sweeter fragrances. From the first spray it was very sweet and pleasant throughout the day. The scent lasted about 6 hours or so and didn't lose any of its depth until after that. This one was by far the closest to retail.  9/10  ##Wild Bergamot  (Dior Sauvage)  An earthy and woody scent with notes of Bergamot, pepper and amberwood. Very strong to start off, maybe a little too strong, but settles after a bit and holds fragrance well for 8-10 hours. Pretty close to the real fragrance and the scent stays longer than the others.  7.5/10  ##Luxurious  (LV Ombre Nomade)  A woody and fruity scent with notes of oud wood, Raspberry and incense. To be fair I have only tried and smelled this in stores but in my opinion is pretty close to the real fragrance. Retail smells much more rich and deeper than this clone but the scent is very accurate and lasted for a good amount of time and settled nicely after a little bit. This is not my type of fragrance but if you like the real version this is a great alternative.   8/10  ##Leathery Path  (Tom Ford Tuscan Leather)  A warm and spicy scent with notes of leather, saffron and black suede. Another strong fragrance to start off but settles in nicely. Not much depth to the fragrance and you have to really breath it in to get hints of the secondary notes. It is fairly close to retail and has good longevity to it.   7/10   ##Aventure  (Creed Aventus)  A fruity and rich scent with notes of Bergamot, black currant, apple and pineapple. From the first spray the scent of pineapple and citrus is very apparent but after it settles in it has a nice sweet and fruity scent. Lasted very long pretty much all day and is pretty close to retail.  7.5/10   If you want to try Chez Pierre's perfumes I'll leave his contacts here:  **W2C**:  [Direct Link](https://chez-pierre.com/samples)  **Whatsapp**:  +381 63 414753  **[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/PxUHm0p)**;;I agree that his TF are usually a miss.

"LV,Chanel",,"Perfume Parlour Review (Creed, Tom Ford, Chanel, Nassomato) https://imgur.com/a/dMH1eiB   Hello,   So here i will be reviewing my order from Perfume Parlour, a UK based website for replica perfumes.   I will also be telling you the reactions i got off of this collection and my relatives favourites!    1. Tom Ford Tuscan Leather (Italian Rawhide 0688)   My initial reaction with this was not good at all. I don‚Äôt know why but i didn‚Äôt like it i think it was the strong raspberry, but as it developed i started liking it more and more.   It smells dark and mysterious and i would definitely see this good if you wear all black and in winters formally. I used to live in Dubai so the oud smell is familiar to me which is out of wood and it is definitely available here and straight up reminded me of the people in my class which drenched themselves in oud but here it is modestly tampered down but still strong.   Before i ordered i heard many mixed reviews on it but decided i‚Äôll try it myself and here‚Äôs the reactions i got   Mum: Nope, i don‚Äôt like it (probs had enough from her co-workers in dubai)   Sister 1: Love it, it smells like arabic people   Sister 2: This is fireeee, defo smells rich but overpowering af don‚Äôt spray much or someone will pass out (first person that gave me a compliment before the review)   Rating: 9.5/10   2. Creed Aventus (Avalanche Fruity 0022)  Very fresh! The pineapple makes it fruity but in a really good and at the opening the pineapple hits you until a couple of seconds where it dies down but can be still smelt!   Definitely good for summer as it‚Äôs not too dark and smokey. Happy fragrance basically ahaha! Would defo see myself rocking this through summer!   Everyone loved it  It really resembles a friendly fragrance which is good in my opinion!   Rating: 8.5/10  3. Creed Green Irish Tweed (0583)  This one.... might be my favourite for summer to be honest. It is very green and fresh at the start which is really good and gives off a tropical free vibe! This might actually end up being my summer signature scent as i love it! I also see it being used for summer night outs as it‚Äôs just refreshing and clean! Not overpowering and friendly!   Everyone liked it in the house but not as much as aventus but i personally choose this over aventus!   Rating: 9/10    4. Nasomatto Black Afgano (Strong Pashtun 0031)  This one was heavily recommended!   The opening is very herbal and really so mysterious to the point where you are not sure if you would like this fragrance or not, give it a couple of seconds and it does a full transformation!   At the start it has very laid down green notes, after it dries down there‚Äôs an obvious oud smell which honestly smells fantastic and not too overpowering. It‚Äôs dark but sweet at the same time and can see this being worn all around but mainly in spring and winter!   As in the picture it‚Äôs seen the actual scent is black üòÇ watch out where you spray it.... i recommended only on skin as i sprayed this on my joggers and it turned black for an hour aha   Rating: 9.5/10     5. Chanel Allure Homme Sport (Cyber Sport 0742)  Was the first one i smelt when i opened the package and was impressed, until i smelt all the rest which were better in my opinion!   Really fresh for summer scent i would see myself using it in the summer but not as much as isle of vert as that might be my signature scent overall!   After the dry down the main thing you can smell is cedar and it‚Äôs not overpowering at all! and it‚Äôs so fresh which is perfect for summer!   Rating: 8/10    Hopefully you like the review!   Here is a link if you want to order, sign up through the link if you want and you‚Äôll get 10% off your order  https://perfume-parlour.co.uk/login/=72920    If you have any questions about them let me know i‚Äôll be happy to help :)","{upvote:24,upvoteRatio:0.95,timestamp:2021-02-26}",Reddit,0,
LV,worth it,"[DISCUSSION] Does anyone here study fashion design or work in the industry? I've been passionate ab designing things since I was a kid, but idk how to even begin or if it's worth trying. I want to design more avant-garde menswear, and shoes. I used to draw designs all the time and would draw sneakers, and I still do. To my limited knowledge, I know that practically I will need to learn things like pattern cutting, and sewing. Also understanding fabrics, dyes and whatnot. What am I missing?  Is it even worth it to go school for fashion design? I don't have the money to go to school. And I also live in Ohio so there is basically nothing here for me if I really plan to get involved. There is no fashion culture or robust industry here.  But then it seems there's also an element of luck and connection. Like Virgil studied architecture or engineering or something, and somehow he ended up in an internship at LV with Kanye West, sold bootleg Pyrex tees and got hyped up by A$AP Rocky.  And lots of people in general just know a guy that knows a guy. As said due to my location, and therefore lack of any ""circle"" of associates involved with fashion in any way, I don't have connects or even a support system that shares a mutual interest.  I see a lot of guys on Instagram that are designing dope shit and pretty much do so just for fun and have made a living in the process. But they all seem to live in LA or NYC. I'm extremely good at networking and have done so very successfully in several other ways, but fashion and art in general is way different.

,"quality,aesthetic","Cr√®me de la cr√®me 2nd Gen AirPods I purchased these AirPods 2 as a spare for my retail pair.  Over the past 6 months, I‚Äôve tested 8 other reps and have never been satisfied with the quality or able to overlook a particular flaw.  Happy I pulled the trigger on this pair: [Ben‚Äôs AirPods (2nd Gen)](https://imgur.com/a/d74Srt9)  Review:  Communication: 10/10 - Ben is conversational in English and very responsive to questions I posed  Representation of Facts: 9/10 - wireless charging does work. [wireless charge test](https://imgur.com/a/W9Hrcpa).  Other features include pop-up function, actual power levels, touch support and activating Siri.  The touch options [settings](https://imgur.com/a/SK1x89E) are not customizable like the retail pair.  Double tap the left and Siri is activated or double tap the right and the song is paused/ resumed or call is answered/ ended.  The connection noises are similar but not exactly the same as retail.  You will not hear a muffled recording of a voice, the prompts closely mirror what is generated by retail  Audio Quality: 9.5/10 - my friend did a blind test comparing Ben‚Äôs AirPod 2s versus my retail AirPod 2s and could not distinguish the pairs.  The bass seems to be stronger in Ben‚Äôs AirPod 2s when compared to my retail pair  Bluetooth Connectivity: 10/10 - I was unable to notice a lag when connecting Ben‚Äôs AirPod 2s versus my retail pair.  In addition, the range of connectivity was clear at 100ft - I didn‚Äôt bother to test any further  Microphone Quality: 8.5/10 - typically replicas can not compete with the retail AirPods microphone quality.  I was pleasantly surprised to not hear any complaints from the person on the other line when using Ben‚Äôs AirPod 2s.  The one exception is when the wind picked up - the retails outperformed Ben‚Äôs AirPod 2s by silencing some of the background noise  Battery Life: 9/10 -  Ben‚Äôs AirPod 2s produced 2 hours & 35 minutes of life listening to music + a 30 minute conference call  Aesthetics: 9/10 - The magnetic lid on the retail AirPod 2 is superior and Ben‚Äôs AirPod 2 stem is slightly thicker.  You need to compare side by side for this to be noticeable  Ordering - I paid $60 with shipping options of $9 EMS or $18 DHL.  Shipping is discounted when buying in bulk.  I had them in hand 6 days later  W2C: WeChat - Famouster0809 (PM me if you have trouble using WeChat) on WhatsApp [text](https://imgur.com/a/DKsAH8U)  Conclusion: I am finally satisfied with AirPod 2 rep that can perform in-line with retail pair I own.  This pair was tested on both iOS 12 and iOS 13 beta.  I have no affiliation with the seller - just trying to spread the word to those who burned through 2x retail‚Äôs cost on reps to date;;arent your photos the same as in his yupoo? http://famouster.x.yupoo.com/albums/69143420?uid=1","{upvote:3,timestamp:2019-07-10}",Reddit,0,

My first haul was just a mini 3.4 kg haul which included a few tees and some BM Lin budget creams as a test run. With this 40 kg haul I started ordering through WeGoBuy during CNY and the start of the Coronavirus situation so it took a little while for everything to get going. I decided to split the hauls between 9-10 kg for each parcel, so I have 2 more on the way while the last one is still waiting for items mostly from weidian. My entire wardrobe was kind of lacking so I decided to get a wide variety of items. After this I'm going to be very picky about the pieces I pick, this was mostly a lot of basic pieces  Parcel Stats  * Weight - 9.7 kg * shipped EMS * price - 995 yuan ($143 USD) * items: 26 * total price of items - $302 * shipped 2/21, received on 2/28  My stats:  * Height - 5'8"" * Weight - 150 lbs * Build - Average  Link to spreadsheet:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w6zDQf2XKmgy2DTlECDpLbHfpuiF3NnitPIFsizqslM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w6zDQf2XKmgy2DTlECDpLbHfpuiF3NnitPIFsizqslM/edit?usp=sharing)  Mobile friendly album of everything on spreadsheet: [https://imgur.com/a/cgoOUDD](https://imgur.com/a/cgoOUDD);;How long did your shipping from warehouse take?

Prada,,"What boots were the gals wearing in the late 90s? Hi guys! I‚Äôm watching Buffy the vampire slayer and I always love the boots being casually worn in the late 90s/early 2000s, they just seem so classy and chic whereas when I try to buy boots now they‚Äôre always cheap looking, and I feel promiscuous when that isn‚Äôt the goal. I also love the fashion in Friends and The Devil Wears Prada. What kind of thing should I be looking for? Mid-calf or knee high? Heel size? Brands? Thanks (I was born in 2003 hence the obliviousness).;;My first pair of knee high boots were 9 west in 1997 I think. They are black leather with a stacked heal and side zipper. Boots were kind of an edgy choice back then. I loved them - my daughter wore them to the Eras tour this summer and got many compliments.","{upvote:18,timestamp:2023-11-10}",Reddit,1,1

Same as before, Pandabuy provides really good service and is very easy to use. Everything went very smoothly and I had no issuses at all with them.

The quality of the fabric feels really nice and it fits really great, I'd suggest to size up once or twice since arms are a bit tiny. The fur sheds a little bit but it's great. Try not to pick it up by the hood when you but it, because one of my hood buttons broke. Other than that I rate this jacket 8/10 cause of the button and the fur.  Diesel cap:Price: $11.63Size: One size W2C: [link](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=724631431214&fbclid=IwAR2GNjfJmsBOX0821wc_hRlT9UbZseR3fYmmBt7JU-IO76vuJb33d_PApsc) Rating: It's not close to retail but the logo looks great and quality wise it's a nice cap. Bought it for my dad and he rocks it proudly. Rating 9/10 cause retail looks different.

But the quality of it is really great, it feels like a bracelet bought from a retail store and looks nice. Can't comment on lead presence since I can't buy tests anywhere. Rating is 10/10, very cool gift.  Diesel belt:Price: $4.19 Size: 3.8 matte black W2C: [link](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=721469125675&fbclid=IwAR0XCk8KCV7AVo6rCE5ewoleJ9YMbsX540weEjpP3q42bIegDZnnDL2rp-M) Rating: I've reviewed this belt before and now I bought it for my dad. Same as before, it's really good and durable. The buckle is very solid and belt is good too. Rating 9/10 beacuse it starts tearing a bit after 4 months of wear.  Carhartt socks:Price: $1.95 per pair W2C: [link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=653734124147&fbclid=IwAR2UtrS-en-Q8ofhqKU9MkJ_Z83Ua38JALNl0qPPdgmpse2QYFc80rHvyfM) Rating: Great socks, texture is very nice to touch and they are durable. Only thing is that they are just a tad bit thin, if you have a big foot, the sock might stretch so much that it will tear a lot easier. For me they are 9/10 since they are a bit thin.  Diesel bag:Price: $19.34 W2C: [link](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=718727749681&fbclid=IwAR2YeoM82hgJr8IXuRRBiw0apAGUaboXWoCWc-Wfj0XBZblcPbFqFYT7i-Y) Rating: This bag for its price is very good. Bought as a gift. Didn't see a single loose thread and shape and leather feels very nice. Only one slight defect is that the leather under the logo is a bit puffy in one spot but it's only noticable from looking up close. Very good bag and much recommended. Rating 10/10.  ERD Portrait Sweater: (OOS) Price: $27.19 Size: L W2C: [link](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6652540320&spider_token=4572&fbclid=IwAR077PAIHcB_SO250FabgRmYqzhiZW09u8xjhUc2yDy8yrPFyiIlR5sl2pg) Rating: Sweater has a very nice material and looks very nice. It isn't really baggy but not slim either, fits a bit weird on me tbh. There were a few loose threads here and there but easily removable. Overall this sweater has nice looks and great material but it unfortunately fits strange just as all ERD sweaters do.

A lot of you have been asking for old and new season Dior stuff, so here I‚Äôve included a lot of new Dior clothes including t shirts and a jacquard sweater.

Saw a post which said these were UV protected but unfortunately I have nothing to test these by myself at home. The material feels quite good and they don't feel cheap.  &#x200B;  **Prada Sunglasses (7/10)**  &#x200B;  Even tough I ordered these from the same seller, they feel totaly different. I won't say they feel bad but they aren't as premium as the others. They do feel good while they are on the nose.  &#x200B;  **Ralph Lauren Shirt green (8/10)**  &#x200B;  The material feels really good and it fits well. It almost feels like it's real, but you can spot the differences at the neck-tag.  &#x200B;  **Ralph lauren Shirt pink (10/10)**  &#x200B;  Definetly my favorite out of this haul. The shirt fits perfectly and is not too tight and not too wide. The material feels high quality and again I have to say you might think it's real. Both Ralph Lauren shirts get a clear purchase recommendation from me. Above all, the pink one is highly recommended, because the color is really beautiful in real life.  &#x200B;  **Adidas Yeezy Foamrunners (9/10)**  &#x200B;  The shoes feel great and they are very comfortable. At this price, the shoes definitely get a buy recommendation. I would give the last rating point if they weren't so tight at the top.  *Processing img m6j3mzhr1a0b1...*;;**Found Taobao/Weidian Links in Linked Post**  https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4399149310  https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=712828194951  **********  ^I ^am ^a ^[bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/k512f6/i_made_a_bot_to_link_to_missing_w2c_from_galleries) ^created ^by ^user ^'Albuyeh'. ^Send ^comments ^or ^whatever ^to ^him.","{upvote:1,timestamp:2023-05-16}",Reddit,0,

"LV,Cartier",,"Chrome Hearts Cemetery Solid Silver Ring + LV Stainless Steel Chain Necklace Review (+ Weight) w2c: Chrome Hearts Ring: https://hlinjewelry.x.yupoo.com/albums/146504676?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4246543 LV Chain: https://hlinjewelry.x.yupoo.com/albums/127308256?uid=1  Starting off the measures, i bought Size 11 measuring my finger with a strap of paper under suggestion of the seller and the ring fits just perfect in my opinion. Necklace is just one size and it fits perfectly on my neck.  Communication with the seller has been pretty good, every doubt i had has been solved and he helped me chose the right size (and he actually did) He sent the item 2 days after I bought and it got 10 days to arrive me. I got me some days before posting the review so i could try them and see how they react to my body and till now no problem at all. Everything feels very good in hand, very solid and qualitative. I did the Ice Test on the ring and it was melting faster that other Stainless Steel items I have so i assume it‚Äôs real silver (it y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know, the silver is hotter than other materials) . Also i polished a little bit with the Silver Polisher and it did. For the chain i‚Äôm wearing this from 4 days non stop and it‚Äôs still shiny like it was when arrived, so everything good.  I also posted weight of them to let you know how much they weight. For the ring it‚Äôs pretty accurate as i saw the same ring having the same weight on Chrome Hearts BST. Don‚Äôt know about the necklace. Another thing that the ring got right is that having the ring with the External Crosses Facing Upwards you can read Chrome Hearts inside, which is something you look for when legit checking Chrome Rings.  Is there lead in these products? Nope, i‚Äôve seen another guy testing for lead on these exact products from the same seller and they turned out being negative, imma post the link in comments.  Cartier Ring and Bracelet Update: They‚Äôre still like new, i tested them for lead and they turned out Negative so everything is also okay with them.;;What‚Äôs the Pandabuy link for the chain","{upvote:2,timestamp:2024-01-09}",Reddit,0,
"Nike,Louis Vuitton,LV","quality,price","Review- LV trainer from Jelly studio Hey guys, hope you all be good during the tough time.   I got my 2 pairs of LV trainers grey/orange from Jelly studio. 43 for myself and 38 for my girlfriend. After the whole purchasing progress and 3 weeks breaks in, here is my brief review of LV trainers of Jelly Studio. Check pics [here](https://imgur.com/a/sZNmgke)  Size: I think I am the few one who brought 38 LV trainer. For me, Nike US 9.5 or Allen Edmonds US 9E goes pretty good to me. I tried LV trainer 42 but it goes little bit narrow. The length is good. Jelly is a very nice seller and he exchanged 43 without a word. So I suggest people who has wide feet like me, try your normal casual shoes size please. For my girlfriend, her feet are very narrow but long. Woman‚Äôs US8.5 runs good to her. After several exchanges, Jelly‚Äôs man 38 LV trainer fits good.  General look. I give 9.6/10 to these shoes. The ‚ÄúLouis Vuitton‚Äù prints are (or maybe) the best in the markets. I tried an authentic one in the local LV retail (not the grey one), Shoes‚Äô sole molding is correct and the leather feels solid. After 3 weeks break in, the end of the shoe tongue is still well constructed. Overall the shoes are very good.  Communication. 10/10. Jelly is nice seller and willing to help you in any issues. Shipment, size, color choice, etc. I cannot recall how many questions I sent to his WeChat. But he still be nice all the way. really worth every recommendation to him.  Price. 700Y. 8/10. I know 100+ dollars for a rep LV is little bit expensive and crazy. But first, the quality Jelly provided is the highest I think, whole leather made, 9/10 details and so many other things, second, if you want a 1:1 (or at least close to 1:1) LV trainer in the market, 700Y is just the medium line.  Conclusion. 9.5/10 recommended. LV trainer seems the specialty of Jelly. If you have the money(700Y) and just like the look of LV trainer, Jelly worth your shot.  https://reddit.com/link/gxj9ta/video/h6i6b0gaj7351/player;;Good review.

Parcel weighs more than 500g  GD-E-EMS is the best who balance the time and speed well  Tips: If you wanna choose GD-EUB, and you may find sometimes can‚Äôt choose it even choose few items which under 2kg because of the system‚Äôs overweight.

,"quality,price,comparison","Busy Stone 40401 FLANK POCKET DOWN BOMBER Review + Comparison vs YC I bought both colorways of YC's 40401, and my busystone grey 40404 arrived today, so I thought I would make a review + comparison.  Review:   Busystone pays attention to detail, having all buttons facing the right direction, no lose threads, and the badge is crisp. The material is high quality, and worth the price. The box is came in was slightly damaged, but nothing worth complaining over. I'd give is a 9/10 overall.  &#x200B;  Comparison:  Busystone Badge:  [https://i.imgur.com/R5eh5Q2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/R5eh5Q2.jpg)   YC Badge:  [https://i.imgur.com/GAHqQqM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/GAHqQqM.jpg)   Badges side by side:  [https://i.imgur.com/D4RvjOy.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/D4RvjOy.jpg)   [https://i.imgur.com/HchGNj0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/HchGNj0.jpg)   YC's badge is slightly smaller than it's supposed to be, revealing some stitching. IMO not a big deal, but busystone nailed the placement and size.  Jackets side by side:  [https://i.imgur.com/2h9lk7A.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/2h9lk7A.jpg)   As you can see, YC has the wrong color for the drop pockets, as well as the reflective strip. The reflective strip and drop pockets are also smaller than they are supposed to be.   Jacket's reflective strips side by side:  [https://i.imgur.com/zGkVCrI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/zGkVCrI.jpg)   Busystone's strip is more vibrant as well as larger, but when comparing to retail, both are off.

If you care about saving money and the general look of the jacket, YC is a viable option. If you care about quality, waterproofness, or accuracy, I would go with busystone.  &#x200B;  /u/busytone  I'd tag YC but I'm unaware of his reddit;;hows the sizing on the busy stone ?","{upvote:7,timestamp:2020-01-23}",Reddit,0,

Nike,"quality,price,comparison","Nike Dunk Low Comparison - EM batch // M batch // L batch I said I'd post a quick comparison of a few different pairs of dunks I copped recently. Today we are looking at :  * EM batch Dunk Low Coast, which sells for ¬•480 and is exclusive to EMsneakers ([link](https://eminem2022.x.yupoo.com/albums/114119827?uid=1)) * M batch Dunk Low Championship Purple - this batch sells for anywhere between ¬•310 and ¬•480 depending on the shoe and these were ¬•380 at the time of purchase (link now dead but search the sub for sellers like Cappuccino) * L batch Dunk Low Coast, ¬•190 from Cappuccino ([link](https://shop1621765644.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4466742144))  EM batch is fairly new to the market and produced in their own factory. M batch for me has been the best price to quality ratio for dunks for a fairly long time, but only for particular pairs (e.g. not SBs). L batch was previously a decent budget option but I wouldn't recommend them now, and you'll see why.  So is the EM batch worth around ¬£12/$14 more than M batch?   Top to bottom - L batch / EM batch / M batch  https://preview.redd.it/l6muwe4gmok91.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8221604e6153057f942883230ce3411002d2483e  First up, the L batch falls at the first hurdle when it comes to the colours of the shoe. The coast colours are not well replicated and the big issue is the lack of sail tint on the white panels and midsole, which the EM batch replicates perfectly. The swooshes have the 'hockey stick' bump on the bottom just before the tick forms which is a hallmark of poor quality batches, and these are miles off the real thing in terms of shape, colour and leather which feels like cardboard.  The EM batch as noted above is great in terms of capturing the look and feel of the real shoe. Having had retail previously the colours are great and this is a real achievement given the subtlety of the sail and coast blue. All key features like the swoosh, panels and painting of the sole look good. The materials are supple and sturdy in key areas, and replicate retail well.  As you would expect, the M batch is the same - the colour looks darker due to the lighting but it is accurate to retail in hand. Again, the M batch looks good in terms of shape and materials - the leather is good and we see the consistency we are used to from the M batch here.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/8r4zhq9nnok91.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d87e836b38ec7a5838469397ab0a2ee4bb9ea25  The flaws of the L batch are again prominent in the top down view.  The toe box is really fat, the heel cup is the wrong shape and the shoe overall is too wide compared to retail, which is a very narrow shoe. The laces and tongue tab are also the wrong share of blue.  The EM batch make a good go of things again - the shape of the shoe is correct and the cuts of leather are even and clean, which is often a flaw with replica dunks. The laces are accurate to retail and so is the tongue tab. If I were to be super critical the lace tab on the tongue is a little bit flimsy and isn't the same material as the tongue itself, but nobody is going to be feeling the materials of your shoes when on foot.  The M batch again looks good - one small critical point is that the tongue is slightly too long and this leads to your foot moving around slightly more when you're breaking the shoe in, but this is barely noticeable. The overall shape of the shoe is good and the laces are accurate.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/8531lphqook91.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c14c9c70528d3c029efc6b439b42ae85d164683  A look a the back of the shoes now, and another F in the chat for the L batch which is closer in height to a dunk mid than a low. This is caused by the leather materials on the upper being too tall - compare the blue back panel with the EM batch - and this has the side effect of everything being stretched. You can see the stitching between the back panel and the Nike tab is covering way too much space, and the nike swooshes are going upwards under the tab rather than a smooth, almost flat progression. The stitching on the NIKE tab is also anaemic.  The EM batch is on top of the M batch, in my opinion, when it comes to the heel. The heel is narrow like retail and you can see the coast heel panel is smoothly cut and fairly short in height, just like retail. The stitching looks good on the NIKE logo, which is thick and raised like it should be. The nike swooshes tuck under the tab smoothly, almost parallel to the three lines of stitching on the sail panel, and this is one part the EM factory got spot on.  The M batch looks pretty good but has a couple of minor flaws that won't ever be called out. The purple back panel is slightly too tall compared to retail and the angle of the swooshes tucking under the Nike backtab is slightly too sharp - however the real calloutable parts of the shoe are good, e.g. the Nike stitching on the backtab and the general quality of the stitching.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ntyp92hxpok91.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21e4b14dd06dd5376214f06281eb5f069ec0d038  Finally, a quick toebox comparison of EM batch and M batch. Pretty much the same here, but you can see the EM batch captures the toebox angle of the front panel, the height of the midsole and the dips in the front panel near the back of the toebox slightly more accurately than M batch. Both shoes have good quality stitching throughout and there's basically nothing to choose between them here.  So who's the winner? Not the L batch is the answer.   But ultimately, you're not going to get called out wearing either of these but from a personal perspective, I found the EM batch got more of the little details right compared with the M batch and it comes back to that question of whether that is worth an extra ¬£12 or $14 to you to make sure you get the most accurate shoe you can and something you're more likely to be satisfied with when it gets to your doorstep.;;**Found Taobao/Weidian Links in Linked Post**  https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4466742144  https://eminem2022.x.yupoo.com/albums/114119827?uid=1))  **********  ^I ^am ^a ^[bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/k512f6/i_made_a_bot_to_link_to_missing_w2c_from_galleries) ^created ^by ^user ^'Albuyeh'. ^Send ^comments ^or ^whatever ^to ^him.","{upvote:2,timestamp:2022-08-29}",Reddit,0,

I also only added the QC pics, but if you need a better pic just comment or DM me.  Stats: 6'1"" and 155lbs. I usually wear size M shirts and 32 pants  **Cross Patterned Pants**  Price -  69 CNY, 9.75 USD  Review - Slim fit tailored, unbranded, and decent quality. I'm a big fan of these. Size was good for me  **Stainless Steel Ring**  Price -  19.90 CNY, 2.81 USD  Review - As advertised  **Maroon Bomber Jacket**  Price -  52 CNY, 7.35 USD  Review - Very thin and cheap, zippers don't work super well. The length is good but its slim-fitting. I wouldn't bother with it, even for the price  **Law of Nature Hoodie**  Price -  42.25 CNY, 5.97 USD  Review - Material is very fleece-y. Print looks good but the fit is kinda tight.  **Charmander AJ1**  Price -  231 CNY, 32.64 USD  Review - Super dope, big fan of these lol. True to size  **Burberry Button Down**  Price -  98.70 CNY,  USD  Review - Inside neck tag is not very good, but the rest of the shirt is fine. Size L worked for me but is slim, size up if you want it a bit more leeway  **Alexander Wang Barcode tee**  Price -  35 CNY, 4.94 USD  Review - Pretty good for the price. Size worked for me.  **Stone Island Patch Tee**  Price -  95 CNY, 13.42 USD  Review - Huge fan- great quality, decent price, good fit, and I love the green.  **Womens Leather Jacket**  Price -  99 CNY, 14 USD  Review - Not high quality leather obviously, but it looks good enough from a step away  **Dragon crop top**  Price -  28 CNY, 4 USD  Review - Pretty much as advertised  **Patagonia Sweater**  Price -  149 CNY, 21.05 USD  Review - Logo looks fine enough. The material is definitely not as nearly as thick or good as retail but you wouldn't really know until you put it on. M works well enough for me but consider going a size up. Honestly, just buy retail Patagonias, they're a great company with quality products and they're not really overpriced  **Denim ~~Chicken~~Jacket**  Price -  48 CNY, 6.78 USD  Review - Nice jacket, especially for the price. Wide fit but the sleeves are just a hair short for me I think  **Leather Jacket**  Price -  65 CNY, 9.18 USD  Review - Gave this away because it was too small. Very slim fitting and needs to be sized up a few times. Quality is not good and zipper sucks. I wouldn't bother with this.  **Burberry Plain Button Up**  Price -  89 CNY, 12.57 USD  Review - Far too small, I saw this from another user and knew I should have sized up more but went with the size chart unfortunately. Neck tag logo is decent  **Women's CDG Cardigan**  Price -  79.90 CNY, 11.29 USD  Review - Pretty nice, material is super soft. Logo and tag are decent  **Maison Kitsune Fox Embroidered Tee**  Price -  58.80 CNY, 8.31 USD  Review - Big fan of this. Good quality shirt with nice embroidery and a good fit. The real version is supposed to be Ader Error x Maison Kitsune and this says CINS error, but their pics show CINS so I knew what I was getting. The link with the Ader error verison was sold out and this was the only other one I could find but I'm totally fine with it.   **Three Stripe Joggers**  Price -  15 CNY, 2.12 USD  Review - Lmao just got these because they were so cheap. I was worried because the from the QC it looked like they were gonna be way to wide, but I actually like the fit. They're wide and comfy around the leg but the elastic ankle still brings it in. Low quality but soft and comfy. Would probably size up again for more length.  **North Face Jacket**  Price -  79 CNY, 11.16 USD  Review - Actually not bad. I thought it was just going to be a cheap, thin shell, but it has fleece inside and is sorta thicker. Logos are decent but the care tag is rife with misspellings lol. Too small for me so size up more.  **Patagonia Long Sleeve Tee**  Price -  39 CNY, 5.51 USD  Review - Print is good. Size L is perfect if you dont like oversized long sleeve tees. The sleeve ends on these are just hemmed and not elastic like some other long sleeves. Not sure which the retails are though.  **Print Tees**  Price -  39 CNY, 5.51 USD  Review - XXL worked out for me. These have super wide neck holes though, I wouldn't bother with the off white versions.  **Blue Camo Jacket**  Price -  142 CNY, 20 USD  Review - Not bad, but not great quality. The site pics say ""Off Whate"" so i was worried, but there's no text on the actual jacket. Sleeves are kinda short so size up more  **TWICE Stickers**  Price -  10 CNY, 1.40 USD  Review - Haha I had to do it  **Stone Island Compass Tee**  Price -  45 CNY, 6.36 USD  Review - decent shirt and nice fit. Back graphic looks fins now but I'm worried it'll wear easily  **FG reflective tee**  Price -  67 CNY, 9.47 USD  Review - Huge fan of this. Great quality shirt and decent price. Must cop. Fitting is good too  **Saint Laurent Ring**  Price -  60.80 CNY, 8.59 USD  Review - As advertised so far  **Gentle Monster Sunglasses**  Price -  89 CNY, 12.57 USD  Review - These are great. Polarized lenses, great quality, comes with all the packaging. Unisex style and they look and feel great  **Canada Goose Sweater**  Price -  69 CNY, 9.75 USD  Review - Great cop. I wanted white but they were out of stock, but the blue is great too. Fit is perfect - TTS. Badge very decent. Would recommend  **Maison Kitsune Lovebirds Embroidered Tee**  Price -  105 CNY, 14.83 USD  Review - I love the look of this shirt. The quality is great too and the embroidery is really nice. Would recommend.  **Cargo Tech Pants**  Price -  89 CNY, 12.57 USD  Review - Meh, quality is not that great and even the XXL were kinda short.;;Nice review!

"LV,Gucci,H&M,Forever 21",price,"Apparle - the daily clothing cost guessing game Hi, [r/fashion](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashion/)!  I figured this sub would appreciate Apparle - a game I recently launched found at [https://apparle.com](https://apparle.com/). Let me know what you think!  The objective of the game is to guess the price of the daily featured product in six tries or less (similar to Wordle). You start with two images and the game reveals more details about the clothing item as you continue guessing.  A new product (could be a dress, a pair of shoes, pants, jewelry, a bag, a watch, etc.) is featured every day. The product could be from luxury, mid-tier, or more affordable brands that you may or may not have heard of such as H&M, Revolve, Gucci, Farfetch, Movado, Forever 21, JCPenny, DVF, etc.  The game will also give you feedback based on each guess (‚¨ÜÔ∏è means guess higher next time, ‚¨áÔ∏è means guess lower).  I‚Äôve also set up an archive mode (just click the clock button in the top right of the header) so you can play past games.","{upvote:1,upvoteRatio:0.6,timestamp:2023-06-14}",Reddit,0,

First time doing a review. Just a short comparison. I hope the photos show what I'm describing better.  Lets go straight to the comparison. Retail will be on the left or Top while Rep will be on the right or bottom part of the photos.  Bought this hoodie from 3125tiger through Superbuy.  Overall the rep feels very close to retail. Thick and comfortable.  **Size:** Retail size L fits similar to Rep XXL.  **Color:** The colors are pretty damn close to retail. Maybe retail is just a shade lighter.  **Hood Shark:** One glance both look similar. Reps shark teeth are wider than retails.  **Bape Chest Logo:** Retails are more embossed and richer in color. Reps bape logo feels a bit more flat.  **Adidas Chest Logo:** Retails are more rounded and thicker. Reps are thinner and kinda flat.  **Bape Sleeve Logo:** Retail print quality is thicker and better quality. Reps print are thin and texture feels cheap. You can see through some areas of the rep logo.  **3 Stripe Sleeve Print:** Retail print are even white lines while Reps are not printed well especially at the edge of the stripes.  **Inner Layer:** This part of the hoodie will be the cause of call outs as the difference is obvious. The quality of both materials are similar though. Retail has small cutouts for ventilation whereas Reps don't.  **COP or Drop?:** Definitely Cop. If I didn't have my retail on hand and place it side by side, I would not be able to tell the difference. Hoodie material and color are so similar to retail that it will be financially wise to get these rather than fork out about 4x more for retail.  Hope this comparison is helpful. Apologies for any lack of info or unclear photos.

I also only added the QC pics, but if you need a better pic just comment or DM me.  Stats: 6'1"" and 155lbs. I usually wear size M shirts and 32 pants  **Cross Patterned Pants**  Price -  69 CNY, 9.75 USD  Review - Slim fit tailored, unbranded, and decent quality. I'm a big fan of these. Size was good for me  **Stainless Steel Ring**  Price -  19.90 CNY, 2.81 USD  Review - As advertised  **Maroon Bomber Jacket**  Price -  52 CNY, 7.35 USD  Review - Very thin and cheap, zippers don't work super well. The length is good but its slim-fitting. I wouldn't bother with it, even for the price  **Law of Nature Hoodie**  Price -  42.25 CNY, 5.97 USD  Review - Material is very fleece-y. Print looks good but the fit is kinda tight.  **Charmander AJ1**  Price -  231 CNY, 32.64 USD  Review - Super dope, big fan of these lol. True to size  **Burberry Button Down**  Price -  98.70 CNY,  USD  Review - Inside neck tag is not very good, but the rest of the shirt is fine. Size L worked for me but is slim, size up if you want it a bit more leeway  **Alexander Wang Barcode tee**  Price -  35 CNY, 4.94 USD  Review - Pretty good for the price. Size worked for me.  **Stone Island Patch Tee**  Price -  95 CNY, 13.42 USD  Review - Huge fan- great quality, decent price, good fit, and I love the green.  **Womens Leather Jacket**  Price -  99 CNY, 14 USD  Review - Not high quality leather obviously, but it looks good enough from a step away  **Dragon crop top**  Price -  28 CNY, 4 USD  Review - Pretty much as advertised  **Patagonia Sweater**  Price -  149 CNY, 21.05 USD  Review - Logo looks fine enough. The material is definitely not as nearly as thick or good as retail but you wouldn't really know until you put it on. M works well enough for me but consider going a size up. Honestly, just buy retail Patagonias, they're a great company with quality products and they're not really overpriced  **Denim ~~Chicken~~Jacket**  Price -  48 CNY, 6.78 USD  Review - Nice jacket, especially for the price. Wide fit but the sleeves are just a hair short for me I think  **Leather Jacket**  Price -  65 CNY, 9.18 USD  Review - Gave this away because it was too small. Very slim fitting and needs to be sized up a few times. Quality is not good and zipper sucks. I wouldn't bother with this.  **Burberry Plain Button Up**  Price -  89 CNY, 12.57 USD  Review - Far too small, I saw this from another user and knew I should have sized up more but went with the size chart unfortunately. Neck tag logo is decent  **Women's CDG Cardigan**  Price -  79.90 CNY, 11.29 USD  Review - Pretty nice, material is super soft. Logo and tag are decent  **Maison Kitsune Fox Embroidered Tee**  Price -  58.80 CNY, 8.31 USD  Review - Big fan of this. Good quality shirt with nice embroidery and a good fit. The real version is supposed to be Ader Error x Maison Kitsune and this says CINS error, but their pics show CINS so I knew what I was getting. The link with the Ader error verison was sold out and this was the only other one I could find but I'm totally fine with it.   **Three Stripe Joggers**  Price -  15 CNY, 2.12 USD  Review - Lmao just got these because they were so cheap. I was worried because the from the QC it looked like they were gonna be way to wide, but I actually like the fit. They're wide and comfy around the leg but the elastic ankle still brings it in. Low quality but soft and comfy. Would probably size up again for more length.  **North Face Jacket**  Price -  79 CNY, 11.16 USD  Review - Actually not bad. I thought it was just going to be a cheap, thin shell, but it has fleece inside and is sorta thicker. Logos are decent but the care tag is rife with misspellings lol. Too small for me so size up more.  **Patagonia Long Sleeve Tee**  Price -  39 CNY, 5.51 USD  Review - Print is good. Size L is perfect if you dont like oversized long sleeve tees. The sleeve ends on these are just hemmed and not elastic like some other long sleeves. Not sure which the retails are though.  **Print Tees**  Price -  39 CNY, 5.51 USD  Review - XXL worked out for me. These have super wide neck holes though, I wouldn't bother with the off white versions.  **Blue Camo Jacket**  Price -  142 CNY, 20 USD  Review - Not bad, but not great quality. The site pics say ""Off Whate"" so i was worried, but there's no text on the actual jacket. Sleeves are kinda short so size up more  **TWICE Stickers**  Price -  10 CNY, 1.40 USD  Review - Haha I had to do it  **Stone Island Compass Tee**  Price -  45 CNY, 6.36 USD  Review - decent shirt and nice fit. Back graphic looks fins now but I'm worried it'll wear easily  **FG reflective tee**  Price -  67 CNY, 9.47 USD  Review - Huge fan of this. Great quality shirt and decent price. Must cop. Fitting is good too  **Saint Laurent Ring**  Price -  60.80 CNY, 8.59 USD  Review - As advertised so far  **Gentle Monster Sunglasses**  Price -  89 CNY, 12.57 USD  Review - These are great. Polarized lenses, great quality, comes with all the packaging. Unisex style and they look and feel great  **Canada Goose Sweater**  Price -  69 CNY, 9.75 USD  Review - Great cop. I wanted white but they were out of stock, but the blue is great too. Fit is perfect - TTS. Badge very decent. Would recommend  **Maison Kitsune Lovebirds Embroidered Tee**  Price -  105 CNY, 14.83 USD  Review - I love the look of this shirt. The quality is great too and the embroidery is really nice. Would recommend.  **Cargo Tech Pants**  Price -  89 CNY, 12.57 USD  Review - Meh, quality is not that great and even the XXL were kinda short.;;üòøüòøno taoboa link for the charmanders how‚Äôd you cop?","{upvote:2,timestamp:2020-06-29}",Reddit,0,
"Nike,LV,Adidas,YSL","quality,price,haul","[Review] Saint Laurent, Celine, Undercover, Rick Owens, Margiela GATs, Korean, silver accessories. ~7 kg, tons of fit pics # PHOTO ALBUMS FIRST!  **[[ALL ITEMS]](https://imgur.com/a/A7xkNMk)**   **[[MINI LOOKBOOK]](https://imgur.com/a/fgWA5cX)**   ## Intro  Enjoy my first review! I worked hard to make this haul informative, well-formatted, and easy to digest with lots of pictures. Each item has a photo album including hanger pics, on-body pics, detail shots, and outfit pics. The format is based on the /r/RepLadies template so I give ratings for Quality, Accuracy, and my Satisfaction for each item.  Most of these items were found through reddit. I kept track of most sources and included ""further reading"" links to old posts if you want to find out more.  Disclosure: this review isn't sponsored in any way and I paid for everything myself.  ## Agent/ Shipping Info  Used Wegobuy. Shipped to Canada with GD-EMS. Did a split haul (2 packages) with my gf so I can't break it down perfectly. Both declared at $14 USD and customs was cleared within minutes for both.  * Package 1: 3.3 kg, 470 Y (~92 CAD). Shipped Sep 18, received Sep 23. * Package 2: 9.3 kg, 1070 Y (~211 CAD). Shipped Sep 18, received Oct 2 (was stuck in China for weeks smh)  I wanted to keep some packaging (shoeboxes) but not others, so I did not check the ""remove all packaging options"" and instead left instructions for WGB on which packaging to keep. They followed instructions on Package 1 but not Package 2, which added a lot of weight :(  DM if you're curious about her items.  ## Stats  Height: 6'0 (182cm)  Weight: 147 lb (67 kg)  Shoulders: 44-ish cm (17-ish inches)  Chest (all around): 91-ish cm (36-ish inches)   Shoe Size: 8-8.5 US, 41 EU. Size 41 in retail SLP, FTF, Common Projects. 9 in Nike, 8.5 Adidas.  # THE ACTUAL REVIEW  ##Jackets   ## **01: SLP Teddy Jacket (Peltiano)**  [[Pictures]](https://imgur.com/a/TtdpprW) [[w2c (Taobao)]](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=609816160011)  [[Yupoo]](https://peltmc.x.yupoo.com/albums/86558580?uid=1&referrercate=3232622)  Size: 46 | Price: 600Y (~114 CAD)  Quality 10/10  * (+) Great.

The package arrived 18 days after i submitted it (27.05 submitted and 14.06 received). The service was great as always and i had absolutely no problems with the order or parcel. I dropped the shoe boxes to make the parcel not so heavy. I insured the full parcel and had some extra services such as the bubble film or the pasted invoice. I paid 405CNY (58‚Ç¨) for the shipping and 75‚Ç¨ for the products.  My Stats: 1,75cm , 70kg  Shoe size: 45  The Products:  Louis Vuitton Trainer: The Trainers are size 44 (Black and white) and 45 (Black) and they fit great. Great stitching, almost no flaws, great 1:1 shoes. They stink a little bit but thats not a problem. They even came with a net so thats really nice. For 27‚Ç¨ there is no better pair of these Trainers i think. Price: 27‚Ç¨. Overall rating 9/10  Louis Vuitton Sunglasses: The sunglasses cost 15 CNY which is not very much, but for that price it is absolutely a very nice cop. I like the design of it and it doesnt even feel that cheap. I dont know if it has UV protection, but probably not. These fit great and can make your fit even better. Price: 2,2‚Ç¨.

"H&M,Tommy Hilfiger","quality,haul,aesthetic","[REVIEW] Tommy Hilfiger Small Essentials, My First Haul ***Hello*** everybody, this was my first haul ever using repfam! it was thrilling in a way but it's finally in my hands, so now I want to give back and give my totally honest opinion with you.  &#x200B;  **Stats**: 22 yo, 163cm (5""4), 48kg.  **Shipping**: Spain, using EUB. (took 5 days)  &#x200B;  I always loved Tommy Hilfiger as a brand, especially the jacket so I was quaking in my feet when I saw the famous ones running around the subreddit. I must say, all of my products are bought directly from medusa, and my experience with him is not bad at all. He was not as bad as people painted him out to be and it only took 3-5 days to get my stuff sent to the superbuy agents. I will list the 3 items I bought from him, and I won't lie, while I'm not discontent, I'm not completely satisfied either.  &#x200B;  **Tommy Hilfiger Denim Jacket**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=565330111407&spm=1101.1101.N.N.a393b12)  Superbuy Agent Photos: ([1](https://img1.superbuy.com/images/app/2019/05/07/0030012115572_2_3_3.jpg?spm=1101.1101.N.N.86477d2)) ([2](https://img1.superbuy.com/images/app/2019/05/07/0030137815572_8_8_9.jpg?spm=1101.1101.N.N.11691f0)) ([3](https://img1.superbuy.com/images/app/2019/05/07/0030271715572_1_5_2.jpg?spm=1101.1101.N.N.2ae9259))  [My own personal taken photos](https://imgur.com/a/ueHsMaj)  &#x200B;  First of all, this is the item I was expecting the most. I will say I'm kind of disappointed in this one. Don't get me wrong, the quality of the denim seems to be pretty good actually, although the size is a little weird compared to clothes you find in stores. The sizes seem wider rather than longer. It looks a bit baggy on me, but the fact that it is short kind of helps mitigate that. Now moving on to the biggest problem I find. The embroidery seems sloppy to me. I've seen gorgeous jackets like this one from the same seller in this subreddit, like [this one](https://i.imgur.com/3ZVOY3Z.jpg) from another user. It looked clean, precise. However, mine looks a bit rushed, the e in ""jeans"" as you can see is coming off in some places and the overall embroidery looks wrinkled. I tried to press an iron to the back of the jacket, trying to smooth out the lines and the wrinkly nature of it, but it wouldn't help it. Which leaves a rather bittersweet taste to my tongue, seeing those jackets I was in love! but in person, I'm not sure I like mine as much, so I'd advise to keep that in mind, since medusa might make different batches that are cleaner than others, although the size of it might influence it as well.  &#x200B;  **Tommy Hilfiger ""Tommy Jeans"" T-Shirt**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=565574879442&spm=1101.1101.N.N.755eb75)  Superbuy Agent Photos: ([1](https://img1.superbuy.com/images/app/2019/05/07/0021303715572_7_3_2.jpg?spm=1101.1101.N.N.c526c14)) ([2](https://img1.superbuy.com/images/app/2019/05/07/0021421315572_5_8_3.jpg?spm=1101.1101.N.N.974c1d3)) ([3](https://img1.superbuy.com/images/app/2019/05/07/0021514715572_2_6_1.jpg?spm=1101.1101.N.N.ec3afbd))  [My own personal taken photo](https://imgur.com/a/jNZgpOc)  &#x200B;  Next I ordered a t-shirt for the summer time! Aesthetically speaking, it looks dope, but it does have its flaws which I am here to talk about. The texture is very, very stiff. I was expecting a softer texture considering people often claim reps have better quality than clothes in H&M and the like, but this is not the case here. H&M t-shirts are softer than this one, I can tell you that. Not only that, but the sizing is rather weird as well. Again, it looks like a baggy t shirt and not fit at all, I might as well use it as a parachute, still cute tho. Wider rather than longer  so I'd try to save it by tucking it into my jeans. It looks good on camera, but I wouldn't say it looks perfect in person.  &#x200B;  **Tommy Hilfiger Sweatshirt**  [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=565623871410&spm=1101.1101.N.N.c935c68)  Superbuy Agent Photos: ([1](https://img1.superbuy.com/images/app/2019/05/07/0052029615572_0_2_2.jpg?spm=1101.1101.N.N.c0de2c7)) ([2](https://img1.superbuy.com/images/app/2019/05/07/0052180615572_5_4_6.jpg?spm=1101.1101.N.N.339c880)) ([3](https://img1.superbuy.com/images/app/2019/05/07/0052304915572_9_3_8.jpg?spm=1101.1101.N.N.b8192e1))  [My own personal taken photos](https://imgur.com/a/u07v09d)  &#x200B;  This might surprisingly be my favourite one out of my haul. Again, the embroidery is a little sloppy, with the threads loosening a little without even being used, but I feel like this one looks most legit. It is much, much softer compared to the T-shirt and I feel like I might use this one out in the streets. It looks comfy and fashionable at the same time. I will still try to use clothing scissors to cut the threads a little and try making it as clean as possible, but it looks better than the jacket and the t-shirt in my opinion, so I'd argue this one is a safe choice for quality.","{upvote:29,upvoteRatio:0.91,timestamp:2019-05-27}",Reddit,1,1

Prada,"quality,haul,popular","[Discussion] Moose Knuckles Finds for Winter Hauls So far, the only dealer I have found selling Moose Knuckles reps is currently Prada Armada. I personally haven't had any experience with the quality of his winter coats. Only thing I have seen were a few reviews posted here on this sub.  Is Moose Knuckles just not popular enough for it to be worthwhile for factories to rep? Anyone else come across other TS with them?

Which is like $150+ american, $200 canadian, $140+ euro etc. 3. I am not very experienced with reps. happy to answer any questions but please do your own research too       my sizes -   168cm tall, thin build  Australian sizing I generally fit:  tops : size 6/8 bottoms : size 6/8 (mostly 8) i prefer my winter wear to be a lil baggier  fyi got everything in a size M      Panda Buy service -   I had no issues with Pandabuy.

Price: **‚Ç¨3.20**  Weight: 277 g  W2C: [**https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=2650937466**](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=2650937466&spider_token=6be6)  &#x200B;  * [Supreme City Arc T-Shirt](https://imgur.com/a/CYr6UTX) (9/10)  Really good embroidery and the blank is not bad. The t-shirt looks real nice in general!  Price: ‚Ç¨19.00  Weight: 233 g  W2C: [**https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=592703238724**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=592703238724)  &#x200B;  * [Off-White Cheap-Ass Industrial Belt](https://imgur.com/a/nAXh6H2) (8/10)  I'm sure it has some flaws for a trained eye but still quite good for the price. Also, I‚Äôve seen some photos around allegedly of this where the buckles and letters look horrible, which is not the case at mine. Also no Will flaw. Some people say it's the wrong shade of yellow but I couldn't care less... It looks quite nice! I would suggest taking a very large size to tie it properly and have some hanging. Matching with an OW t-shirt and shoes and you got yourself an awesome fit!

It was for a friend, so I have not tried this on myself.  Price: ‚Ç¨23.00  Weight: 149 g  W2C: [**http://miqifashion.x.yupoo.com/**](http://miqifashion.x.yupoo.com/)  &#x200B;  * [Supreme Swimming Trunks](https://imgur.com/a/oCvNIKA) (9/10)  I don‚Äôt know about 1:1ness but this actually is pretty good and at a very fair price! Pleasant surprise! However, one note. This is probably not a good material for swimming trunks... This takes AGES to dry.  Price: ‚Ç¨9.00  Weight: 248 g  W2C: [**https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=566546509891**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=566546509891)  &#x200B;  * [Supreme x Swarovski T-Shirt by KingShark](https://imgur.com/a/qtq8aak) (9/10)  I don't wanna hear anything about the slight misalignments and empty spaces and stuff. This is unnoticeable irl and it looks damn SICK! I love this thing! Too bad this is too extreme for most cases, I would wear it all the time!  Price: ‚Ç¨26.00  Weight: 222 g  W2C: [**https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=593202864465**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=593202864465)  &#x200B;  * [Lacoste Boxers](https://imgur.com/a/AxKkABN) (6/10)  Meh... The logo on the front is not embroidered but just badly stitched. I feel like this will fall off at any moment... However, really nice fit.

Adidas,,"Just thought of a conspiracy that explains the adidas QC lately.... What if managers of some stores are buying a shit ton of reps before they officially drop, like we are able to for a lot of drops, (just like the static‚Äôs, the cactus jacks, and the lundmarks) and then switching them out for the retails in their store. Then they take the retails and flip them and let someone buy the ‚Äúretails‚Äù that are actually reps, but since you‚Äôre buying from a legit store, you have no choice but to believe they‚Äôre real and that it‚Äôs just adidas bad QC.
