# Classification Folder

This folder contains the necessary files for the classification component of the CZ4034 Information Retrieval project.

## Files

1. `abbreviations_list.pkl`: Python dictionary containing slangs and abbreviations as keys and their respective full word as items.
2. `bert_classifier_final.ipynb`: This notebook contains the training and evaluation of the BERT classifier.
3. `ensemble_model.ipynb`: This notebook contains the final ensemble model used to label the unannotated data.
4. `ml_classifier.ipynb`: This notebook contains the training and evaluation of the traditional machine learning models. Also contains the inter-annotator score computation and random guessing.
5. `roberta_classifier_final.ipynb`: This notebook contains the training and evaluation of the RoBERTa classifier.
6. `LSTM_subjectivity.ipynb`: This notebook contains the training and evaluation of the LSTM classifier for subjectivity detection.
7. `LSTM_polarity.ipynb`: This notebook contains the training and evaluation of the LSTM classifier for polarity detection.
8. `models/`: Contains the saved models for the BERT and RoBERTa classifiers as well as vectorizers.
